I have it, I sent you an email about it. Hey everyone!      We are hosting a solution session to all the homeworks from this past week in GHC 4303 right now! We wont be posting homework grades until next Wednesday, so this is your only opportunity to see if you got everything right before the midterm on Monday.       Andrew Correct you would not be able to use the word apple. You would need 2 ps in your hand to make that word.Hi Coral,    The count is 4 because there is technically an empty string before the string, after the string, and in between each character.      Andrew  Hi Zhao,      When you round anything with a .5 at the end, it will round to the next largest integer value. So in this case, the next largest integer from  1.5 would be  1. So that test case is correct.
