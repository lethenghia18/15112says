 Hi all,      This is a heartfelt congratulations to you all from the TAs and me on your amazing accomplishments and on finishing the term projects! This week was intense and we have seen you pour so many hours to get a complete and working term project! I am truly so proud of all you have learned and how hard you have worked to get the term projects working!      We will be finalizing the tp grades tomorrow morning and the final semester grades tomorrow afternoon (latest Tuesday morning).      Enjoy the rest of today and take a break from 112 and other things that have kept you busy this first half of the summer!      Best,   Rudina  Good morning all!      In less than 7 h, you will be done with 112!! That said theres a couple of things to keep in mind as you wrap up your term project:       You should really not continue to code past noon today. You should take the rest of the time to make your video, clean your code, and get the submission ready. And especially do not try to add any big last minute features as you may end up with a non working term project because of bugs you introduce last minute.       The deadline is  today at 5:00 pm  and really, we wont be accepting any late submission (no exceptions!). So have your submission ready and submitted by then. Try to submit at least a few minutes early so you do not encounter any unexpected errors.       Your zip file should not be larger than 10 MB or Autolab will not accept it. If because of images and music files and any additional library files your submission is more than 10 MB, you will have to omit some of the media files and get your submission to be under 10 MB. Then separately you should share the full TP submission with your mentor through Google Drive, or Dropbox, or flash drive or anything else that you may want to use.       Read Max post 489 to help you with video creation (and reach out to your mentor if you have any issues). We will be using these videos for grading tomorrow when we all get together as a staff, so make sure you have this done.       You should have the TP3 meeting with your mentor today and you should have already heard from your mentor about this. If you have not please email me asap. All these meeting will need to happen by tonight!       Please refer to the TP assignment  on the web for any further clarifications and make sure to follow the instructions. If you have any questions, please let us know!      Good luck wrapping things up! We are looking forward to seeing how all your learning and hard work has come together to produce amazing term projects!      Rudina  Hi all,      TP 2 grades have also been posted (thanks to the hard work of the TAs who were able to do this all only a few hours after your final submissions!)      Please take the feedback to heart as it reflects where we think you are headed as a final tp grade (it doesnt mean you would get the same score, could be higher or lower depending on the progress you make for tp3). If you are not sure why you got that grade and what you need to do between now and tp3 to get a better grade, please make sure to email or meet with you mentor and they will be able to explain more.      In addition, if your mentor has indicated that you code is lacing complexity, please take that to heart as well and really think how you can best spend this weekend to add complexity to your project. TP2 grade also reflects the progress you have made between tp1 and tp2. So be careful, even if you think you are satisfied with the grade now, if you lack complexity at the end of TP you may get a lower grade than your current TP2 grade. Again, reach out to your mentor if you are not sure whether your code is algorithmically complex enough.      Rudina        Hi all,      Midterm 2 grades have now been released. You guys did a fantastic job overall!! The average was an 84 and the median an 87! The midterm was hard and this definitely reflects just how hard you have worked and how much you have learned these past few weeks! 112 is definitely so much more challenging during the summer so I am so proud of you all for how much you have learned and how much you have grown as programmers.      Now just keep the momentum going and wrap up your term project! You have 2 more days of 112 and you will be done!!      Rudina  Hi all,      We have just released hw 4.2 (Tetris  Snake), hw 5.1 (OOP Flappy Bird) and hw 5.2 (TP attendance) grades. If you think we have made any mistakes you have until Sunday at 1:00 pm to let Kyle (kdchinandrew.cmu.edu ) know so we can make any necessary adjustments. We reserve the right to not consider any requests that are made past this point (and thats primarily because of logistic reasons since we will be computing final grades Monday morning).      Also, we will be releasing midterm 2 grades after the TP deadline tonight!      Rudina  Hi all,      If you have not done so, please please fill out the FCE. This really means so much to me and the department and if you can just take 3 5 minutes to let us know how you found the course, I would be super grateful!      And in addition you get 3 points on quiz 2!      Thanks,   Rudina  Hi all,      A few more announcements/reminders:      (1) Most importantly,  please back up your code . Either send an email to yourself with the current version of TP, or use a flash drive or use dropbox (or anything else you typically use). Just do whatever you need to do to save what you have now. Your computer could crash or you could make changes to your code that will make it not work when it was working a few minutes ago. If that happens you will always have a version to go back to. If you do not back up your code and somehow end up losing your code (say because your computer crashed) or end up having code that doesnt work anymore, we wont be able to accommodate you. So consider that you have been warned! Every semester someone will end up bearing the consequences because they did not back up their code. do not let that be you!      (2) You must have seen points taken off in tp1  for blown citations . This includes code that you took from the lecture notes (such as run() ) that has not been cited. do not repeat the same mistake for tp2. You will lose 10 points for blown citations in tp2 and even more in tp3. So be careful. Cite all the code that is not yours. We are reading through all of your code and if we notice any blown citations we will not be lenient!      (3) You must have received an email to complete the FCE (Faculty Course Evaluation). As with the mid semester feedback, this is very important for us so that we understand how to better ourselves and how to make the course better. Please, please, please complete it. It shouldnt take more than 3 5 min. To motivate you to complete it, we will give  3 points on quiz 2  (which was one of the lower scoring quizzes) for anyone that completes it. You must send me a  screenshot of the completed FCE by tomorrow  (which is when the FCE site closes) to get the points.      Rudina  Hi all,      All the information regarding tp2 and tp3 deliverables has been posted on our course web . Please make sure to read this very carefully.       Tp2 is due this Friday at 8:00 pm . You cannot used late days and  if you submit late you will receive a 0 . You should have scheduled a meeting with your mentor by now. These meeting are not optional and you will lose 10 points  if you show up late or do not show up at all. You should have  a  working demo  of your project by the time you meet with your mentor and if you do not you really need to make a detailed plan with your mentor about how you will achieve a working demo by Sunday (a working demo is a requirement for getting a B or higher).       Tp3 is due on Sunday at 5:00 pm . You should aim to be code complete by Saturday night, the latest Sunday at 10:00 am. You should allocate time to polish your code and make the video (which can take time especially if you have never done this before). We will post some further instructions/resources to help with the video creation. You must then have your TP3 meeting by that Sunday night, no exceptions! We will be grading your term projects really early Monday morning and we need to have all the meetings done by then. Again, I will make another post with more details about the TP3 meetings, but the website really has all the details you need to know (read Receiving your grade section).       Autolab : Both tp2 and tp3 will belive on Autolab at 6:30 pm today. Some students are leaving early which is why tp3 is on Autolab so early. When you submit tp2 tomorrow, please make sure to submit to tp2 and not tp3. As for tp1 (and as stated on the website), you need to submit a  .zip file  for both tp2 and tp3. For more details, read on the course website .      I know you guys have been working really hard to get the term projects to work. We will definitely take into account all the effort you have put in so do not stress too much. Please reach out to me and/or the mentors if you get stuck and need to talk to us or get some more 1 1 help.      Last few day! We are almost done!      Rudina        Hi Zoe,      You would have to create an instance of the WithAnimal class. You wont be able to access the subclass just because you have created an instance of the super class.      Does this help?      Rudina  Hi guys,      I will have to start my OH at 1:45 today instead of 1:30. Sorry for the inconvenience and see you soon.      Rudina  Hi again (last post for tonight),      The grades for quiz 5 have been released. You guys did super well, with the average being an 87 and the median a 92!!! Good job!!      We still have to grade hw 4.2 and hw 5.1a. These will be graded and returned to you by Thursday. The midterm should also be graded by Friday. So we are planning on having all the grades other than the tp grades released by this Friday. That gives you about 2 3 days so reach out to us with any regrade requests!      Good night and hope you are all getting some rest!      Rudina  Hi all,      Tomorrow (Tuesday) my OH will be from  1:30 pm   3:00 pm , and for the rest of the week (Wednesday, Thursday,  Friday)they will be from  1:00 pm   2:30 pm ! Come stop by if you have any issues with the term project, need help debugging something or want to chat about features you should add or consider!      Now, a few reminders:     No lecture for the rest of the week!!        Recitations will be optional OH (so now we have OH from 2:00   6:00). You should go to OH if you are stuck with the implementation of a particular feature, or need help with anything tp related. Yes, your term project mentors are an important resource, but they are there to chiefly mentor and guide you through your term project. OH still remains the most important place to go when you need debugging help. You should not be emailing your TP mentor to set up a 1 1 meetings only to have them help you with debugging. We have seen that OH are underutilized, so make sure to go to OH first!        No more hw, quizzes or other assignments!        You cannot use late days on any of the tp assignments. You only have 1 week to complete the term project and hence we wont be allowing any grace days!      Have fun with the term projects! :)      Rudina  Hi all,      You are now officially done with all midterms, quizzes, and assignments!! One last thing to do and you will be done with 112!!      At this point, you should have all heard from your mentors and you should have scheduled a tp1 meeting with them (which is mandatory). If you have not heard from your mentor or you have not scheduled a meeting yet, you must email me asap.      As for the tp1 deliverable, until we get the instructions posted on our web, please refer to the deliverable 1 section here . In Summary you will need to turn in a .zip file to Autolab containing the following:     Project Proposal    Competitive Analysis    Storyboard (just take a picture of your hand drawn images if its more convenient)    Code Artifacts (if any)    A timesheet     Have the meeting with me regarding using external modules (if you are using external modules)      This will be due at 8:00 pm tonight and Autolab should be live around 1:00 pm today.      Tp 1 and Tp 2 will be worth 10% of your TP grade, while Tp 3 is worth 80% of your Tp grade.      Let us know if you have any questions and make sure to take advantage of my OH today (11:00   1:00 and 2:30   4:30) as well as your meetings with the mentors.      Rudina  Hi all,      For the exam tomorrow, you will be responsible for everything up to the Friday lecture. So do not worry about backtracking or floodFill. Again super important concepts, but wont test them on the midterm!      Good luck!      Rudina  Hi all,      Since we will switch to TP week on Monday and given your tp 1 will be due on Monday, which includes submitting a TP proposal as well as meeting with me to get the approval to use any modules, I will hold additional OH to help you transition into TP week :)      I will be having OH from 11:00 am   1:00 pm, then 2:30 pm   4:30 pm.       If you are having a hard time deciding what to do for your term project, or you do not know if your term project is complex enough, or just want to get my feedback, please stop by anytime during my OH and I will be happy to chat.      Additionally if you are using a module and need to get my approval, please stop by during my OH (no need to email me). However if you really cant make any of these times, then please send me an email so we can schedule a time to meet.   For these meetings, be prepared to walk me through the code you have written and also be prepared to make any changes on the fly that I may ask you to make. This will be a test of how well you understand the modules and if I believe you do not have enough fluency, we will have to talk about a term project that does not use the modules. Just getting an online demo working in your computer is not enough. You have to understand that demo and be able to make changes to demonstrate that you are comfortable using that module.      If you are working on getting the modules going, feel free to go to OH this weekend too. The TAs should be able to help you with that as well :)      Rudina  Hi all,      The autolab for hw 5.2 (your last hw!!!) is live now.      One thing to mention regarding largestFile() and using the samplesFiles folder: On Macs you will notice .DS_Store file which will end up being your largest file always. To remove it use this script . Download the script and place it in the same directory as the samplesFolder. The run the python file as you normally run any python files (from Pyzo or Sublime or whatever else you are using) Should remove all the .DS_Store files! :)      Good luck wrapping up this hw and make sure to take advantage of all the review sessions and resources we are offering tomorrow to help you prepare for the midterm.       Rudina     Hi all,      hw 5.2 has been posted on the web . It should be much more lightweight hw than past hw and especially than the hw you are currently working on!      I will talk more about the TP lectures tomorrow, but at least for now you have the titles, times, and locations of these lectures so you can plan ahead which ones you want to attend. You are required to attend 2 of these as part of this hw.      Note the hw is due on  Saturday at 10:00 pm  so you can use Sunday to study for the midterm on Monday.      I hope that this easier hw helps you catch up your breath a little bit as you prepare for a really busy week ahead!      Rudina  Mansi, looks like you are passing all the tests now :)  Yup, will do that in just a few minutes! :)  Hi all,      There were 2 Autolab issues that I just fixed:      (1) if you are getting an error for the quadratic class that says: almostEqual is not defined that means you have to have the almostEqual function defined before the #ignore_rest line. So make sure to do that!      (2) if you were getting an error for multiply polynomials that says something like return True expected but return None encountered, the error should have been fixed now (it was an Autolab error).      Because this was an error from our side, we are adding another 2 submissions to everyone.      Hope this helps! :)      Rudina  Hi all,      You can start submitting hw51a and hw51b to Autolab now.      Note they are separate assignments in Autolab so you must submit 2 separate files, one hw51a.py and one hw51b.py.      You have 5 submissions for each assignment.      Good luck wrapping up this hw!      After this one were down to only 1 more hw!!      Rudina  Hi Yuqian,       have you tried to understand what the difference between __mul__ and __rmul__ is? That will give you a big hint on how to approach this question.      And regarding using while loops, for hw51b you are actually not allowed to use any while or for loops and Autolab will catch that if you do. You should be able to solve the problem completely using recursion only. This about what we talked today: how can you break the problem into a smaller problem of the original form?      Hope this helps.      Rudina  Hi all,      As I briefly mentioned in class yesterday, for your term project you will have a mentor who will be your first point of contact throughout the development of the project. I will give lots more details about this and the term project logistics on Friday, but for now please fill this form  to indicate your preferences about the TP mentor.      This form is optional so if you do not fill it by  noon tomorrow , we will assume that you have no preferences and will randomly assign one of the TAs as your TP mentor.      While we cannot guarantee everyone will get one of their top choices, well do our best!      Rudina  Hi all,      As many of you have noticed, the Polynomial class was asking for variable number of arguments to be passed to the constructor. This was a mistake from my side, since we have not yet covered that topic (and in fact will not cover it at all). I have removed all those test cases that asked for the variable length constructor and so now all should be good.      Really sorry for the confusion.      The hw on the website has been updated to reflect this!      Rudina  Hi all,      Hw 5.1 has been posted on the website . It is due Thursday at 5:00 pm. Note this hw has 2 parts: hw51a (OOP and Animations) and hw51b (Recursion). You will be turning two separate files on two separate Autolab assignments. Just make sure to read all the instructions at the top of this page  and you should be fine. You should be able to do all of hw51a after tomorrows lecture (you can still do OOPy Flappy Bird and the Polynomial Class without tomorrows lecture), and all of hw 51b after Wednesdays lecture.      In addition, you will notice that as part of the assignment there is a required 5 minute TP meeting with your TA this week. This is just to make sure you have started thinking about your term project and have some general idea of how to move forward. I will talk more about this during lecture tomorrow.      We are soooo close to being done. This is another challenging week as we wrap up two of the harder 112 concepts (OOP and Recursion), but you have done most of the work at this point and are really close to being done with 112!!      Keep up the hard work!      Rudina  Hi Kenan.      This is open for interpretation since we have not fully specified, so up to you!      Rudina  Hi all,      Quiz 4 grades have been uploaded to Autolab. As I mentioned today during lecture, you guys did very well! This truly reflects a lot of hard work from your side! So very well done!!      The average was an 81 and the median was an 85!      Keep up the hard work! We are approaching the finish line with only 2 more hws,1 quiz and 1 midterm left before transitioning to term project week!!      Rudina  Hi all,      Since many of you are reporting to be wrapping up now and just need a few more hours to finish everything, we are extending tonights deadline to 10:00 pm.      Hope this helps with wrapping everything up!      Rudina  Hi Rosie,      Nope, no such specifications were made in the write up. The poison can stay where it originally was.      Rudina  Hi all,      You will be submitting  multiple files  for hw 4.2:     snake.py :the top level function here should be run() so when run() is called, the snake animation should start.     tetris.py :the top level function here should be run() so when run() is called, the tetris animation should start.      In order to do this, you will need to put all of your files into a single folder named hw42 (note no comma between the 4 and 2), then  zip that folder into the file hw42.zip . You can find instructions about how to create a zip file here . Be sure to only submit a single zip file. Any other archive types (such as .rar and .tgz) will not be accepted.There is no autograder for this assignment but you will still have to submit through Autolab. And as always we will only grade your last submission. You can start submitting to Autolab at 10:30 pm tonight.      For any misformatting errors or wrongly named functions, we will be taking  5 points off so please make sure to follow the guidelines.      Have fun with the hw!      Rudina    So since now you have two separate files (snake.py, tetris.py) turned in as one zip file, you do not have to make a playTetris() function because to play tetris we would just have to call run(width, height) in the tetris.py file. The same goes for snake.py!      Hope this helps :)     Hi all,      As promised, heres the full details about Alternate Minimum Grading (AMG)policy:      The AMG policy is available to everybody, but is designed specifically for those students who struggle in the first part of the course and then through sustained hard work and dedication manage to elevate their performance in the latter part of the course to a level that merits passing with a C, even if their Standard Grade might be lower than that.  In addition to Standard Grading on the syllabus, we will separately compute your grade using an Alternate Minimum Grading (AMG). Students do not sign up for AMG. Every student will be considered both for Standard Grading and AMG, and their semester grade will be the higher of the two (where the highest grade via AMG is a C).  To compute your Alternate Minimum Grade, use the following to compute your score:      Homework (week 3 onwards): 25 %   Midterm 2:                40 %   Quiz (3, 4, 5) :              10%   TP :                      20%   Participation:              5%      So basically we are ignoring the assignments and quizzes for the first 2 weeks and placing more emphasis on weeks 3 6.      The course syllabus  has also been updated to reflect this.      If you have any questions or just want to talk more about this, send me an email and Id be happy to meet and chat!      Rudina  The original link has been fixed now. :)  Niki, just to add to what has already been said, its actually an html error, where the html thinks it need to add the    and I could not get the html to remove this line. So just remove it when you paste the code.      Rudina  Hi all,      hw 4.2 has been posted on the web . The first question is related to snake, which we will develop in lecture tomorrow (its also linked in the hw writeup). The code is up online though so you can check it out if you want to get a head start. You have all the animation knowledge to understand the code, but tomorrow well be able to develop it step by step.      In addition, as you may have noticed, we adjusted the midterm grades by adding 3 to everyones grade, which brought the average to a 77!! Again, while there is room for improvement, these result are solid and show that you have made great strides over the past 3 weeks, and that you are emerging coders and problem solvers!!      Keep up the hard work! This coming hw, while challenging, should be a lot of fun and give you a great sense of accomplishment as with only 4 weeks of coding you will be able to write Tetris! :)       Rudina         Hi all,      You will be able to submit to Autolab starting at 6:00 pm today.      Also, I posted the code  for getCheapestRouteWithLayover() which we developed in class today (Its in Lecture Notes 4.1). Make sure to really understand this code as it is a more complex example using dictionaries. You are likely to see a similar question on midterm 2.      Finally, if you are interested in participating in the study (and get paid) that your classmate shared with you this morning, please emailyalic1andrew.cmu.edu .      Rudina     Hi all,      We really hope that 112 has been a good experience for you so far. We know it is intense and we have been teaching you quite a few concepts in a short period of time.      We still have another 3 weeks to go though, and so we really want to hear from you about how the course is going so far so that we can make any changes necessary moving forward. This impacts you directly, so if theres something that you really like about the course and you want us to continue doing please let us know and equivalently if there is something that really bothers you that you think we can change please let us know as well. To that end, please fill this form here .      In addition, the TAs who have been working really, really hard to support you also want to hear from you to see how they are doing and how they can improve to better support you. To that end please fill this form ,  one per each TA  you wish to provide feedback for.(You are encourage to share your feedback not only for your recitation TAs, but also for TAs you have interacted with at OH, review sessions, etc).      Because hearing your feedback matters so much to us, if you complete both forms (the course evaluation and  at least two TA feed backforms), we will give you 4 points on quiz 3. Because the forms are confidential and we are not collecting any information that identifies you, to get the points, you have to send an email to me with the screenshot of all the forms you have submitted (i.e the screen that shows after you hit submit on a google form). In the email just let me know how many TA forms you have submitted.      You need to log in with your andrew account to fill the forms. You wont be able to access the forms otherwise.      Please complete the forms and send me an email by  noon tomorrow .      Rudina     Yup, can confirm its a typo. I will update the hw!      Good catch!      Rudina  Hi all,      Hw 4.1 has been posted on the web . It is due on Thursday at 5 pm. The last problem is an animation problem, and you should be able to do that problem after the lecture tomorrow. The rest are based on efficiency and more directly on sets and dictionaries which we covered today.      You will have only 4 Autolab submissions for this hw and you will be able to start submitting to Autolab starting tomorrow afternoon (likely after recitation but maybe beforehand too).      Rudina  Yup, you will, in just a few minutes.   Hi all,      In case we didnt make this clear: The exam is tomorrow in lecture from 9:00 am   10:20 pm.      In addition, after the midterm tomorrow we will completely shut the course down for a day. That means no hw, no office hours, no recitation, no Piazza. We want you to fully take a day off 112 after having spent an entire weekend finishing the hw and preparing for the midterm.      So go out and relax for a bit after the midterm. Maybe treat yourself with a good lunch or just watching some Netflix. Do whatever relaxes you and do not think about 112 for a day!      So keep pushing hard until tomorrow and then just take the day to relax a little bit before we start the second half of 112!      Rudina  Hi all,      Quiz 3 grades have been uploaded to Autolab.      The scores this week were lower than in the past two weeks, but they still reflect a great amount of learning and effort from your side. The average was a 68 and the median was a 70. Most of the points were lost in the first 2 problems which primarily tested efficiency related concepts. We know that efficiency is a more theoretical and maybe somewhat abstract concept and so it takes some more practice and time to get used to. But it is an extremely important concept because in real life correctness of code is really only part of the story. Imagine if all the applications you use took even just a few seconds to load (imagine each Facebook or Instagram photo you opened took 5 seconds to load). It makes user experience so not pleasant and sometimes it also just makes the applications not usable. So being able to develop and analyze the efficiency of the algorithms you come up with is super important and you have to continue to strive to learn these concepts.      And the only way to learn is to practice! With that, I hope that you are taking advantage of the review sessions today to practice in particular concepts that you find challenging and confusing (such as efficiency).      You will be tested on efficiency on the midterm tomorrow and the questions will be a bit harder than the quiz questions so please take advantage of the review sessions and OH today to practice, practice, practice and clarify thing you are not sure about!      Keep up the hard work! After the midterm tomorrow you are more than half way done with the course!      Let us know if we can help you with anything or if you just want to chat. Were always here to help!      Rudina  Hi Anupam,      Have you tried running your code on powers of two, say unboundedNumberGuessing(4)? What happens?      Rudina  Hi Shenhan,      Yes, you do need to write test functions for the modified version of you code to make sure the lists are still being sorted.      Rudina  Hi all,      The autolab for hw 3.3 is live now. Remember that we are testing for efficiency this week as well, so if your solutions are not efficient Autolab will indicate that your code is inefficient and you will not get any points (even though your solution could be correct). Because its the first week we are testing for efficiency, we decided to increase the number of submissions to 8!      Rudina        Hi all,      We gladly accommodate students with university approved extended time (as approved by the Office of Disability Resources (ODR), as explained here ). Just a reminder that, for midterm exams, the ODR proctors the extended time versions of these.      If you are one of the students that have such an accommodation and need if for this coming midterm on Monday, you should email me asap ( the latest noon tomorrow) to let me know (and you should also either stop by my office to give me the university approved form or email it to me) and then I will be in touch with the next steps regarding the midterm on Monday.      Best,   Rudina  Hi all,      Given that todays lecture was a bit tough, we have decided to not include hashing and sets in the midterm (or as you may have noticed the hw that was already released).      So for the midterm on Monday, you are responsible about everything up to mergesort (which we covered at the beginning of lecture today). We will go over sets and hashing again on Tuesday and hopefully well be able to find an easier and better way to explain the material. I know hashing can be in particular confusing so if you felt lost during lecture today, do not worry as we will go over everything again on Tuesday after the midterm.      Regarding the midterm, the format will be very similar to that of the quizzes (with a few CT, ROC, and FR and likely some short answers). As has been true for the quizzes, if you want to get a better sense (and practice more!) of how the midterm will look, you can always look at past iterations of 112 and see how midterm 1 was in past semesters. Heres  one of the past midterms for example (note we have not covered animations yet so you can ignore questions that involve animations). You can expect the length, format, and difficulty of the material to be very similar.      Again, the TAs will also be writing a practice midterm for you all which you can take in a proctored setting for more practice. More on that to come really soon!      Rudina  Hi all,      You are almost done with the hardest week of 112!! For most of you that finished the Memory Game, well donee!! Its a really amazing achievement to see how far you have come in just 3 weeks (being able to write your own console based game!!)      As we wrap up this week, theres one more homework to finish! Hw 3.3 was just released on the web . It is due on Saturday at 7:00 pm. You have 5 total Autolab submissions and be careful this time since we care about efficient solutions and Autolab will test your code for efficiency. So it is possible that your code is correct but if it is inefficient you may not get any points. So please read the questions carefully and make sure toread the feedback from Autolab if you end up loosing points for efficiency.      As I mentioned in class,we are imposing an earlier deadline on this hw so you can take Sunday to review and prepare for the midterm. We will be offering many events to help you prepare (review sessions, practice midterm, etc) and will make a post on Piazza soon to let you know of the schedule.      Meanwhile, keep at it as you finish the last homework for the week and get ready for the midterm 1. Youre almost there!!      Rudina  Hi all,      As many of you have been asking and since we did not explicitly talk about this in class, heres just a quick example of how to generate random numbers:       Unlike most other cases we have seen so far, the bounds of random.randint are both inclusive.      For the hw, you need to generate a board with random numbers each time you first create the board. There are many ways in which to go about this, but many of these involve using the random.randint() function.      Hope this helps!      Rudina     Hi all,      The hw 2.2 graphics grades and style grades have been released.      Collectively you did really well on the graphics so good job!! :)      Style grades are better than the ones from the last hw but there is still a lot more space to improve as many of you lost 5 points on style. Please make sure to read the comments that the TAs have provided so you do not make the same mistakes in the hw you will turn in tomorrow (which will also be graded on style).      And as always all regrade requests go to Kyle (kdchinandrew.cmu.edu )      Rudina  Hi all,      hw 3.2 has been posted on the web .      In this hw you will be implementing a Memory Game. You can look at this online game  to just get a sense of what this game is about. However the version you will be implementing is a console based implementation, similar to the console based version of Connect4 we implemented today.      Many of the ideas (such as board printing and taking input from the user) follow directly from the Connect4 example we developed in lecture today. You will be reviewing Connect4 during recitation as well so make sure to ask questions and form a good understanding of how we implemented it so you can implement the Memory Game. Also, feel free to use any parts of the code from Connect4 that are applicable here, so long as you cite them. You will loose point if you do not cite the code.      The hw specifies many of the rules of the game but theres also quite a few decisions left up to you. For anything we have not explicitly specified in the write up, feel free to makechoices as you see fit.      The hw is manually graded but you will still need to submit to Autolab. You have 4 total submissions and we will only grade your work based on your last submission.      Rudina  Hi Cristina,      Why are you using is? Did you mean to just check if the two numbers are equal as in 22 == 4 and 95671085 == 10652?      Please let me know if I have misunderstood your question.      Rudina  Hi Rosie,      Nope, that sounds like a fine approach. We have not just yet (I know I mentioned this in class) formally discussed efficiency and you have not yet learned data structures (i.e sets and dictionaries) that can help you be more efficient so your current approach sounds fine.      But its really great that you are thinking about efficiency! :)      Rudina  Hi Rosie,      From the hw write up: If no such words exist, return None.      Hope this helps!      Rudina  Autolab is live now and you can start submitting.      Remember, you only have 5 total submissions for this hw!      Rudina  Hi all,      Hw 3.1 has been posted on the web . It is due tomorrow at 5:00 pm.      The few reminders which you should know by now:   1. we will be grading for style and you can loose up to 10 points   2. you only have 5 Autolab submissions.   3.Autolab will go live some time later this afternoon (around 8:00 pm).   4. You may not use anything we have not covered in class yet (i.e recursion).      Rudina        Hi Tanvi,      the function cannot be destructive.      if you set b = a[:], can you test if doing such an operation creates a copy or an alias of a list? If it creates a copy you can go ahead and implement the function that way :)      Rudina  Hi all,      Our amazing TAs have worked hard to grade quiz 2, the manually graded portion of hw 2.1 and the style for hw 2.1. The score are all released in Autolab now. Remember, all regrade requests should go to Kyle (kdchinandrew.cmu.edu ).      As expected, most of you lost almost all the 5 points for style. Please make sure to check your score in Autolab and click on it to see why you were deducted the points. This is super important as you get ready to submit hw 2.2 for which you can loose the full 10 points for style.      As for the quiz, the average was again a solid 75 and the median a solid 78!! The scores do reflect your collective hard work this week so well done! That said, there are still some of you that are finding the quizzes challenging. As Ive said many times in class, please reach out to us and lets work together to help you learn the material and make the most out of this class. We are here to help!      Meanwhile, good luck wrapping up hw 2.2 and keep up the hard work!      Rudina  Hi all,      Autolab for hw 2.2 is now live and you can start submitting.      Remember you only have 5 submissions and the max autograded score is 60. The rest will be manually graded.      Thanks,   Rudina  Hi Cristina,      Try the following in your shell:          What do you see when you print that line? Is extend a destructive or a non destructive method? What does the method .extend return and why?      Rudina  Hi Coral.      I cannot reproduce your error. Can you post a bit more code and maybe the function call as well?         Rudina  Hi Coral,      Try printing what chr is right before you make the first call result = chr(97).      Can you see what is happening and why?      Rudina  Yup! Good job! :)  Hi all,      hw 2.2 has been posted on the website  and it is due Sunday at 7:00 pm. A few things to note:      1. There is no starter file. You have to create your own .py file and submit it to Autolab. You can take a previous starter file and modify it appropriately. 2. We will be grading this hw for style. This time you can loose up to 10 points. Well try to give you back the style scores for hw 2.1 tomorrow so that you know not to make the same mistakes for this hw. So watch out for those grades.   3. Youmay not use recursion, sets, dictionaries or any other constructs that we have not yet covered in class.   4. We will make Autolab live some time tomorrow afternoon (I will post when it is live). As you may have noticed, we will release Autolab later and later so as to prevent you from using is as a debugging tool. You should test your code extensively before submitting to Autolab.   5. You will have only 5 Autolab submissions this time.      Thanks,   Rudina        Hi Kenan. You can read more here:https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex10.html       As a side note, as you get more comfortable with programming and move along in computer science, youll notice that it becomes increasingly more important for you to be able to explore code and also search for answers yourself. So while we are happy to help, try to search for the answer a bit yourself (especially when its concepts you are interested in learning more about) as that will be a very useful skill for the future :)  Hi all,      Another important post for today: As I said in class, we want to support you as best we can and help you get the most out of this class. That includes teaching you a super useful skill:  debugging .      We are continuing to see the trend of simply asking us where the bug is. We will not answer such questions, not in Piazza and not at Office hours. You have to start adding printing statements and observing how your variables change so you can catch your mistakes.      We will also show another example of debugging in lecture tomorrow to help you more in this regards, but as you wrap up the hw today and try to figure out where your bug is, pleasedo not ask us to find the bug for you. We will be happy to show you how you can use debugging techniques to find your bugs, but will not find the bugs for you. That is one of the most important skill that you should learn in order to succeed at whatever you do after being done with 15112.      Rudina  Hi all,      After some more thought, we have decided to turn recitation into OH as well. So we will have OH today from 2:00   10:00 to help you wrap up this homework.      And tomorrow during lecture well help you review the material from this week and prepare for the quiz!      Hope this helps with the load and the learning!      Rudina  And you will have an extra 3 submissions for this hw. So now you have a total of 8 submission!!        Hi all,      Seeing as this hw is challenging, we will be extending the deadline of the hw to 10 pm tonight. In addition we will have OH from 6:30 pm to 10 pm (right after recitation).      To be eligible for this extension though you have to go to recitation today otherwise you cannot have the extension and we will enforce that.      If you absolutely cant go to recitation you need to send me an email and youll need to have permission from me in order to be able to have the extension.      Best,   Rudina  You may start submitting to Autolab now! Note there are 65 total autograded points. The rest will be manually graded!  Hi all,      A few misc things to keep in mind as you work on the hw:      1. As I mentioned today in class, pleaseread the style guideline  carefully. In particular, someone asked whether all your helper functions have to be tested or whether its just the top level function that needs test cases. All functions need testing and that includes helper functions. In real life applications, you first actually make sure the smaller functions work well and so you write lots of test function for the helper functions. That gives you some confidence that the building blocks of your program work well and then you can worry about putting these pieces together.      2. Please make sure to download the file that is linked in hw 2.1 . In particular there is a framework for the graphics that we want you to use. This ensures consistency among all of your submissions, so if you do not download and use this file, you will actually loose points for formatting errors of your hw submission.      3. for patternedMessage, note this important instruction: [...] returns a string produced by replacing the non whitespace characters in the pattern with the non whitespace characters in the message ( where any leading or trailing newlines in the pattern are first removed )      So for example, if you look at one of the following exampleswe have provided you with:           would print the following:          We can use print(repr(pattern)), which just prints how python internally stores the string (i.e instead of showing you a new line it shows the \n character and this makes it easier for you to debug and see where any mismatch is occurring). In our case :          would print the following:       Note how I can easily see that the pattern in this case has trailing new lines (a new line at the beginning and a new line at the end). You are supposed to remove these trailing new lines for the function to return the correct output.      In recitation today the TAs will also talk about this briefly, so make sure to ask any clarifying questions.      4. We will likely release Autolab a bit latter than planned (originally planning on releasing it at 5:00 pm but will actually release it at around 8:00 pm tonight). This shouldnt really impact your progress, because you are testing your functions thoroughly, right?      Keep at it!      Rudina              Hi all,      At the top of the posted hw 2.1, Ive included the following instruction: You may not use lists for this homework with the following exception: you can use split and splitlines methods of strings within a for loop (as shown in class). Otherwise, you are not allowed to have a variable that points to a list.      What does this mean?      Today in class, we covered .split() and .spiltlines() and in particular we had the following lines of code:       <code></code>   or          You can use the same for your hw (i.e use split and splitlines methods of strings within a for loop). What we did not mention in class is that when you do       or          a list is actually created with the content of the string as elements of the list. So really what you are doing is looping through a list. So you are implicitly using lists but that is okay for this hw.      However we do not want you to use list explicitly in this hw as we have not covered those yet, so please do not do that as again Autolab will catch it and you will not receive any points.      Hope this clears things up.      Rudina  Hi all,      As many of you might have noticed, hw 2.1 has been posted on the website  and it is due Thursday at 5 pm.      A few things:   1. The graphics will be manually graded, while the first two problems will be autograded just as you have been used to.   2. Your graphics code should be below the #ignore rest line, and the only code that should be above it is whatever you write to solve the first two problems.   3. We have not provided any test cases this time, so you have to write your own and test your code.   4. We will be grading for style on this hw. Well cover a few more points tomorrow during lecture. You can loose up to 5 points for style on this hw. In the future hw you can loose up to 10 pts.   5. You only have 5 Autolab submissions, so use them wisely and test your code thoroughly before you submit to Autolab.   6. You wont be able to submit to Autolab until tomorrow at 5:00 pm.      And make sure to go to OH and small group sessions and utilize all your resources!      Rudina        Hi all,      Many of you are reporting being confused about the implementation of find() in particular because theinstruction say If index is given, the start of s is considered to be the given index.      This means that if I have the following string s = abbabba and I call find(s, bb, 2), I start searching for the string bb in s starting at location 2. I would return 4 because I found the string bb in s starting at location 4. Note how I did not return 1, even though the string bb occurs in s starting at location 1. The index parameter of the find function simply specifies where to start searching. The outputof the function is still with respect to the starting point of the original string  s .      Hope this clears the confusion.      Rudina  Hi Benjamin,      Please take a look at 77 . Hope that helps!      Rudina  Hi all,      Our wonderful TAs graded all of your quizzes last night and the results are pretty good: average of 76 and median of 87. The standard deviation is large though which means that some of you found the quiz more challenging and have more work ahead to catch up. Please make sure to reach out to me and your TAs, go to office hours, use Piazza, and take advantage of all the resources that are available to help you. We are here to help and support you.      The grades are up in Autolab and you should be able to see them. We will hand quizzes back during recitation on Tuesday. Our TAs are truly wonderful and while mistakes in grading do happen they are very rare. If however you still think that there was a mistake in grading please send all your regrade request to our assistant head TA Kyle (kdchinandrew.cmu.edu).      Keep up the hard work!      Rudina  Hi all,      As the hw specifies, you are NOT allowed to use string methods. So for example you cannot do the following:       The whole point of these functions is for you to write these methods. String methods include (not limited to): s.isalpha, s.isdigit, s.islower, s.isspace, s.isupper, and so on.      You also cannot import the string module and use that.      You can use string slicing, looping, len(), chr(), ord().      Let us know if you have any questions!      Rudina  Hi all,      Two important things for the quiz today:   1. Show your work. do not work on a scrap paper and then just put your answers in the quiz. We want to see your thought process so just use the quiz to show that. This is particularly important for CT and ROC. So whatever you need to write, please write it in the quiz. We do not need you to write an explanation for the answer that you got, but if as part of solving the problem you need to keep track of certain variables, write them down on the quiz. Then there will be boxes where you can put your final answer.      2. For CT and ROC make sure to put your final answer in the boxes weve provided.      3. For todays quiz, you are not allowed to use strings, lists, or recursion. Were using similar rules as to what we have used for the hw so make sure to follow those or you may not get any points on the quiz.      Good luck!      Rudina  Hi Vidya,      Actually theres been a misunderstanding here. You are not allowed to use s.upper() or s.islower(). The whole point of these functions is for you to write these methods yourself.      Really sorry for the confusion. But otherwise the hw would be trivial.      Best,   Rudina  Hi again,      hw 1.4 has been released and it is due Sunday at 7:00 pm. A few things to note:      1. You will have only 8 Autolab submissions this time.   2. Please make sure to read the test cases carefully especially for the string method functions (i.e isLower, isAlpha, etc).   3. Please follow the rules we have specified in the file:You are not allowed to use lists, or recursion. And you are not allowed to use any string methods or import the string module. Again, if you do, Autolab will catch them and you will not get any points and will waste a submission.   4. We will start covering strings tomorrow and this hw makes use of that so some of the questions will require tomorrows lecture. The first few questions though are still entirely based on what we have covered so far.   5. The hw includes longestDigitRun which youre solvingin labtoday. However, the recitation and hw versions are slightly different so make sure to read the problem statement carefully before assuming anything.   6. You wont be able to start submitting to Autolab until tomorrow at 8:00 pm. As the weeks progresses, we will make Autolab live later and later. This is to prevent you from using Autolab as a debugging tool.      Rudina  Hi all,      I keep forgetting to mention this in class, but if you look at the website from past semesters of 112, you will find that most topics that we cover have videos associated with them. Feel free to watch them and use them to clarify any concepts. Could be a great way to review the notes as well.      In addition, some of you have asked how to best prepare for the quizzes. Part iterations of 112 have so much practice problems and past quizzes that we have given, so you should have a lot of material to review for the upcoming quizzes. Id recommend going over a few problems from past 112 quizzes that cover the same material we are covering this week. Do the past quizzes while timing yourself. Make sure you can solve the problems within the time limit. It will be tough initially but keep at it and practice, practice, practice! You will get much better the more you practice!      The quiz tomorrow will have 2 Free Response, 2 CT, and 2 ROC. Everything weve covered up to and including todays lecture and recitation will be fair game for the quiz tomorrow.      Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions!      Rudina  Hi all,      I know this is a last minute post, but hopefully you all see it before class. Please bring your laptops to class today as we will try something slightly differently! :)      See you all soon!      Rudina  Hi all,      Hw 1.3 has been posted on the website and its due tomorrow at 5:00 pm. I know the back to back hw can be overwhelming, but this should be the only week we have hw due back to back. Well try to keep hw deadlines on Tue, Thu, and Sun.      Same rules as in hw 1.2:      1. You will have only 10 Autolab submissions so use them wisely. We will only grade on your last submission, no exceptions!   2. For this homework, youare not allowed to import any modules, or use strings, lists, or recursion. If you do, Autolab will catch it and you will not get any points at all.   3. You can start submitting to Autolab at 8:00 pm tonight when the hw will become available on Autolab.      And make sure to utilize OH and Piazza for any questions you may have!      Rudina  Yup, you are :)  To add to that:We have defined our own round in the hw function and do not necessarily want to follow the built in. This is a slight divergence from what we solved in class today so it was intentional :)  Hi all,      hw 1.2 has been posted on the website . It is due tomorrow at 5:00 pm.      A few things to note:   1. You will have only 10 Autolab submissions so use them wisely. We will only grade on your last submission, no exceptions! Also when using late days, we will check when your last submission was made when calculating if you are using a late day or not.   2. For this homework, youare not allowed to import any modules, or use loops, strings, lists, or recursion. If you do, Autolab will catch it and you will not get any points at all.   3. You can start submitting to Autolab at 8:00 pm tonight when the hw will become available on Autolab.      Have fun with it!      Rudina  Hw 1 Autolab is now live and you may start submitting hw1. You should all have access to Autolab now, but if you do not please send me an email asap.      Note hw1 is due tomorrow at 5:00 pm and for this homework only you may have unlimited amount of submissions. This will change starting with the next hw since we do not want you to use Autolab as a debugging tool and want to instead encourage you to take the time and test your code. All good skills to have! :)        Pleasemake a separate Piazza post so we can carry the discussion there. Responding here will spam the entire class.      Thanks,   Rudina  Hi Jennifer,      Yup, that did impact the roster. We have you now in our roster and will be sending an email to you shortly.     Come stop by at OH! Will be here until noon.  Hi all,      A few important announcements:       1. Piazza usage    As mentioned in class, we will be using Piazza for all official communications so it is your responsibility to check all the posts and make sure that you are following all the announcements/instructions.       2. Website    The official summer website ishttps://cs112.github.io Thats where you will see the lecture notes, the hws, links to Autolab and Piazza and the OH online queue.       3. Hw1    Hw1 has been posted and it is due tomorrow (May 23rd) at 5:00 pm. We will be setting up Autolab today and will let you know when you can start submitting to Autolab. do not try to submit until we officially let you know that you can do so even if you have access to Autolab and can see the assignment.       4. Recitation sections    Finally, regarding recitation sections, you will get an email in your inbox thattell you what your recitation section is and what room you have to be in. Make sure you check your inbox!  Also, any syllabus info?  Hi Kenan,      The instructor will be Rudina Morina. We will soon activate the course webpage where you can see the syllabus and schedule and get more information about the class in general!
