 No, its Friday.  Hi Suraj, dont panic weve seen that problem. Sometime the system acts weird. I think you need to import os module and then add some prefixes to access your file. Turgoogling the details as Im googling too. Hope this helps.  Hi Xinyu, chances are you got your arguments position swapped when you pass them in to your function.   Whats inside your draw is problematic too if your arguments are at wrong positions but its short circuited and python didnt even see whats inside your create_oval yet.      hope this helps,   blair  I think it makes sense not to change it.  Hi Zhou Chen! Yes you can assume that there are space between each word. Good luck!  Hi Kenan,      If you look at the write up, it is because 123444444 has 6 consecutive 4s, and therefore we return 4.      Hope this helps.  HiRosie!      I think myRound rounds to the nearest integers instead of rounding down. Hope this helps!     Hi Zoe!      I dont think thats the reason why, if its not defined it should be a runtime error in your code given by python.      The reason why we discourage using round is that the behavior of round in python 3 may be unexpected. For example: round(1.5) returns 2, and round(2.5) also returns 2. Instead you can use math.ceil to round up and math.floor to round down.      Hope this helps!
