 Hi Rosie,      It seems your polynomialStr function doesnt work as expected. I would recommend making sure your output string matches the expected string exactly, and making sure youve tested all the edge cases.      Hope this helps!   Aditri Hi Vidya,    Sine the homework specifies not to import the string module, you cannot use these functions.  Aditri  Oops, I thought you were referring to string methods like .upper(). You should be allowed to use .islower() and .isupper(). Sorry for the confusion!  Hello Coral,      No, any ordering of numbers would not make x a rotation of y.      Consider1234.   Here, think about how you would form all the possible rotations by sequentially taking digits off the right side as follows:      123  4   &gt; 4123   12 34    &gt; 3412   1 234    &gt; 2341   and finally, 1234.      However, 4321 is not a rotation as it cannot be obtained in this manner. Hope that made sense!   Aditri  Hello Yuqian,      While recitation problems are not generally posted, youre welcome to come to office hours and wed be happy to coverany concepts from recitation that youd like to go over again!   Hope this helps:)   Aditri
