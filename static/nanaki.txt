Hi Zoe!    Look at some of the graphics demos. When creating text, you can specify your font and font size. Im not sure about downloading other fonts, but you can definitely change your font from the default.        Nanaki Her office GHC 4109!Hi Rosie!    Just a few (4 5) should be okay. We just want to make sure youve researched your project and put a lot of thought into other models.     Nanaki  Hi Coral!      So think about it this way: we want to possibly rearrange the values of L into a new list, M, that will be summish (if its possible to do so with this list). Remember the structure of backtracking problems. You want to continue to try to build up your answer using your isLegal function. If your isLegal is false for all of the next possible values, you would reset your list to what it was previously and continue trying other values. I would recommend looking at the course notes to get a feel for the structure. That will be the most helpful, I think!      Nanaki  Backtracking is recursive because we keep calling the solve function on a certain value and if no values at that level work, we change the value in our solve function to the previous working value. You dont need to make all permutations of a list    thats the reason why we backtrack. Making all permutations is too slow and defeats the purpose of this.      You would need to check which values in L make the new list, M, summish at all times. Thats how you get the permutations most efficiently, because youre creating this new list solely from permutations which work. Again, I would look at the nQueens example on the site to see how they checked rows in all rows (this may give you more inspitation!)    <span style="background color:#fff">Hi Yuqian!</span> <span style="background color:#fff"> </span>  <span style="background color:#fff">Until its posted online, the link to the quiz is in post 436 about yesterdays review session.</span>  <span style="background color:#fff"> </span>  <span style="background color:#fff">Nanaki</span> You need to make sure youre logged into your andrewid in your browser.

Nanaki Hi Tanvi!    As the directions, say your Obstacle class should have an isColliding method (regardless of what is in your Bird class).     Nanaki Hi Mansi!     <span style="background color:#fff">If youre using code that we have given you then you should cite it.

Have you tried usine depth printing and testing out some small perfect numbers like 6? If you try that Im sure youll see what is being returned at each depth of the recursion, so youll be able to pinpoint where/how to modify your code.     Nanaki Hi Yudi!    If youre using code that we have given you then you should cite it. In general, we recommend against copying code from class and whatnot because youre not learning as much as if you wrote it on your own.     If possible, try to write those sections of code from scratch and compare them to the notes you took in class.     Nanaki  Hi Daphne!      If you have a helper function it should be recursive because no iteration is allowed for that problem. You can solve it both ways, but using a helper function could be beneficial!      Nanaki  <span style="background color:#fff">Hey Chen!</span>  <span style="background color:#fff"> </span>  <span style="background color:#fff">The yes really part was just a jokey comment about how rmul calls mul.</span>  <span style="background color:#fff"> </span>  <span style="background color:#fff">According to google, __rmul__ is called in the following situation:</span> <span style="background color:#fff"> </span>  <span style="background color:#fff"> </span> <span style="background color:#fff">When two objects are multiplied, python tries to call the left objects __mul__ method. However, if that method doesnt exist, then python tries calling __rmul__ on the right object, and the reason it uses __rmul__ instead of __mul__ for the right object is because it wants to inform the right object that it is actually the right operand instead of the left. (Info fromhere )</span> <span style="background color:#fff"> </span> <span style="background color:#fff">Hope this helps!</span>  <span style="background color:#fff"> </span>  <span style="background color:#fff">Nanaki</span> Hi Chen!    From the test cases, it looks like the coefficients need to be in a list, so I would treat it as such :)     Nanaki Hi Cynthia!    You need to download the images file first!     Nanaki   Hi Kenan!    So if I remember correctly, you have the displayed squares as the empty color in a 2d list. You should be able to check the row,col values of the list in the respective positions to make sure theyre the empty color!     Nanaki Hi Anthony!    There is a pause feature in the original code, but the writeup specifications of the pause feature are slightly different (color changes and whatnot).     Hope this helps,     Nanaki Hi Shuangni!     <span style="background color:#fff">So since youre submitting these files separately then in one zip file, you dont have to make a playTetris() function because to play tetris we would just have to call run(width, height) in the tetris.py file.

Youre not required to do the bonus. Also for sure, if the problems dont specify, feel free to adjust accordingly :)     Nanaki Hi Daphne!    Since the hw is just adding on features, you should retain features from the original snake such as this one, unless the writeup tells you otherwise.     Hope this helps,     Nanaki No problem! So since youre supposed to increase the speed of the snake, setting data.timerDelay to a value in your init will affect the speed of the snake. In the run function we set it to 100 (milliseconds), but if you would like to change the timerDelay you can. There are other ways to change the speed of the snake, this is just one! There should be some animation examples that change the timerDelay on the website!    Nanaki  Hi Shaojie!      The writeup states If the snake runs into a wall, it does not die, but rather it destroys the wall at a cost of 1 point. If that would result in a negative score, then the snake dies. You dont affect the snake unless the score becomes negative, which is when it dies.      Hope this helps!      Nanaki Hi Chen!    Its the second one. Remember though that if its the last square remainjng it doesnt matter!     Nanaki  Hi Zhao!      So you can separate your init into specific inits. For example, yesterday in recitation we could have made a birdInit(data) which we could have in init to store all the bird variables. Then if we wanted to reset just the bird data, we could call birdInit(data) instead of init.      Hope this helps!      Nanaki Hi Regine!    Unfortunately we will only grade one .py file, so you cant submit both separately. To avoid confusion, you could title two functions tetris and snakes respectively and have them call the run function.     Nanaki It should be darker!Hi Rosie!    Just remove that line and run it!     Nanaki So its because the framework was using buttons    try this linkhttp://www.kosbie.net/cmu/spring 17/15 112/notes/notes animations examples.html#snakeDemo !!Hi Suraj!    So you can separate your init into specific inits. For example, yesterday in recitation we could have made a birdInit(data) which we could have in init to store all the bird variables. Then if we wanted to reset just the bird data, we could call birdInit(data) instead of init.     Hope this helps!     Nanaki Hi Niki!    Are you missing a parenthesis/have incorrect indentation?     Nanaki   Remove that line and try it!!Sets, dictionaries,and animation!All of them, pretty much. They just show you how to implement those topics in different ways.Yes! You can look at time complexity online too to check out other cases :)     Hi Anupam!    Have you tried debugging this via printing or another method?     Nanaki Hi Yuqian!    Make sure the run function is below the ignore rest line    that should solve this issue!     Nanaki I would copy the same ignore_rest line from an old starter file just to be 100% sure &#x1f60a;Hi Rosie!    When you rotate the figure, you want to move how youre drawing it i.e. the points youre using to draw the figure. In rotations, you want to move those points in a circle. One way to go about doing this is to think about how we can use math to find how moving these points in a circle will change the angles used. Think about manipulating some math operations and youll get it!     Nanaki Hey Kenan!    That error means that youre trying to index into an integer. Make sure that all the times youre indexing, youre actually indexing into a list. Print debugging would help!     Nanaki Hi Yudi!    the key should map to an empty set.     Nanaki Hi Chen!    You can use dictionary methods if you think theyll benefit you!     Also for the wheel, we define inside as within the boundaries of the wheel which includes the wheel outline, if thats what youre asking.     Hope this helps!     Nanaki Hi Cynthia!    Yes! I kind of answered that in your last post just now :)     Nanaki Hi Cynthia!    We dont want to include anyone . For example, if we have d = {fred:set([wilma]), wilma:([fred,betty])}, we should return {fred: set([betty]), wilma:set()} because fred isnt his own friend of a friend and both fred and wilmas names shouldnt be in their own sets of friends of friends. Also, <span style="background color:#fff">this set should exclude any direct friends, so if betty had been in both of their original sets of friends, we would return{fred: set(), wilma:set()} because shes a direct friend of both.</span>  <span style="background color:#fff"> </span>  Hope this helps!     Nanaki Hi Yudi!    See the comma between dino]) and betty? it looks different than the other commas (I dont know why) but maybe thats your invalid character!     Nanaki Yeah sometimes that happens its really irritating to find    one way to locate it is to try to print it all as a string character by character and pyzo should crash on the weird character (ideally)Hi Yuqian!    You need to be logged into your andrew account to view it. If youre logged in with another email it wont work.     Nanaki Unfortunately the only links I also have available are those in Rudinas post. Id recommend logging into gmail with your andrew id in a private browser and copying the links there, if possible. If this still doesnt work email Max or Kyle and theyll help you out in the morning!Let me know if it does work, too!Hi Coral!    You dont, but they wouldnt hurt!     Nanaki Hi Vidya!    You have all of class (so 9 10:20) to take the midterm. It should be in your normal auditorium. We also dont have recitation or OH tomorrow.     Nanaki Hi Yudi!    So when you set b = a[0:2] youre creating a shallow copy of a so all the elements of b are aliased to those in a.     That being said, when we set b[0] = 5, were changing the arrow that pointed from position 0 in b to point to this new element (5). When we change b[1][1], were changing the values inside an element which is aliased to both a and b. Were changing the arrow that pointed from <span style="background color:#fff">b[1][1] to a new value. Since b[1] is a[1] (because of aliasing), a[1][1] is changed to the same value as b[1][1].</span>  <span style="background color:#fff"> </span>  <span style="background color:#fff">Hope this helps!</span>  <span style="background color:#fff"> </span>  <span style="background color:#fff">Nanaki</span> Hi Isabella!    So those problems usually occur when theres a weird character in your code    I would recommend going to OH and having a TA look at that.     Nanaki I cant see exactly whats wrong    I would email kyle or max and ask them to take a look for you!Hi Cynthia!    You should still write test functions for the last problem because you want to make sure your code sorts the lists. You should have them return sorted lists.     Nanaki Hi Kenan!    If you followed how we explained finding the bigO of functions line by line based on the types of inputs (i.e. lists, strings, integers), loops, and methods, then youre fine.     Nanaki Hi Kenan!    You should still write test cases for them because you want to make sure they do in fact sort the list.     Nanaki Hi Shannon!    So the question states that you want to bubble down the lowest elements to the front of the list until the list is sorted as opposed to how bubbleSort usually works where it bubbles the greatest element and moves it to the back of the list until the list is sorted. Its kind of like a reverse bubbleSort.     If your solution does this, then youre good!     Hope this helps!     Nanaki Hi Cynthia!    <span style="background color:#fff">Since this example follows the constraints of the question, it does have balanced parentheses (i.e. it doesnt go into any of the false conditions listed as examples). Balanced parentheses doesnt require the string to be symmetrical.</span>  <span style="background color:#fff"> </span>  <span style="background color:#fff">Nanaki</span> Hi Chen!    Since this example follows the constraints of the question, it does have balanced parentheses (i.e. it doesnt go into any of the false conditions listed as examples). Balanced parentheses doesnt require the string to be symmetrical.     Nanaki  Hi Tara!!      So your initialtest case looks close to being correct, but lets analyze it. Up to the 22 it looks good    you know that 22 is too low, but you have to remember you found that 24 is too high. That being said, the only place you can look is between those two numbers, so n has to be 23. You wouldnt need to check 24 again after checking 22 because it was the last upper bound.      Hope this helps!      Nanaki Hi Mansi!    Have you tried debuggin by printing? You could do that and try the inputs that arent working to see when exactly they fail (in the while loop or wherever).     Hope this helps!     Nanaki    Did you try printing inside the loop?  Hi Chen!      So our small group sheets are specific to our recitation sections, so only Andrew, Nikolai, and I use the same sheet. That being said, you can the CT in your editor and see what it returns! Youre close, but slightly off!      Nanaki Hi Ashwin!    You can write test functions for functions which use random if what the function returns has some level of consistent structure. For example, if you have a function which randomly assigns card values to spots in the board, you should be able to test it because every card value should appear exactly twice in the board (with the exception of the empty card). Every time you were to run this function, you would always have elements appear twice, so that is testable.     Hope this helps!  Nanaki Hi Max,    No you dont!     Nanaki Hi Yudi!    You only need to write test functions for functions which return things and dont take user input. You dont need to write test functions for functions which take user input or require graphics.     Nanaki Whoops I forgot   you also dont need to write test functions for functions which use random! Hi Yudi!      Im sorry I mislead you    I was under the impression that you didnt need to write a test function for random but in this case you should. Since you should be able to check the number of times each element appears in the board you should write a test function for this.      Sorry!      Nanaki Hi Cristina!    If its not specified in the spec then its up to you.     Nanaki That would be appropriate! Hi Max!      If a player selects the empty card, then it would not count as having 2 of the same cards. As part of the spec, 2 cards are only permanently shown on the board if their values are the same, so an empty card would not have the same value as an integer on another card.      Nanaki  Hi Tanvi!      The location of the blank card should be random.      Nanaki  Hi Mansi!     Since memory game is not an animation or graphics function you are limited to 20 lines.      Nanaki  Hi Coral!      No you do not!      Nanaki  Nope!  Hi Coral!      Im sorry I mislead you    I was under the impression that you didnt need to write a test function for random but in this case you should. Since you should be able to check the number of times each element appears in the board you should write a test function for this.      Sorry!      Nanaki  Hi Coral!      I would recommend using help because in the spec it requests that you include a  help command :)      Nanaki Hi Niki!    In the problem, we stated that we wont test past 26x26 board. So that should take care of your problem.     Nanaki  Hi Cristina!      Regardless of the users response, you enter it into playersMove, right? You need to check the order of how you interpretsomeones response and how you call your function. Youll find your answer there.      Nanaki Hi Vidya!    From the spec, a help command here would just <span style="background color:#fff">explain how to enter commands. Its up to you how to do it, but a hint could be to interpret specific input and then display the rules.</span>  <span style="background color:#fff"> </span>  <span style="background color:#fff">Hope this helps!</span>  <span style="background color:#fff"> </span>  <span style="background color:#fff">Nanaki</span> Hi Vidya!    The repr function will show you all the charaters in your string and will represent whitespace characters by their symbols (e.g. \n for new lines. Try using repr(printBoard(board35)) and repr(print35) to see all the characters which are represented in those strings. You might be able to find your error there.     Nanaki  Hi Vidya!      You actually only need to write test functions for functions which return things and dont take user input.      Hope this helps!      Nanaki  Hi Daphne!      You should use the builtin random function!      Nanaki Hi Vidya!    Why are you using center? Just curious. String formatting would be appropriate.     Regardless the only difference between you trying to use .center is that youre calling it on * and 3. Compare the types of these objects and youll find your answer!     Nanaki  Oh thats my bad! Ive actually never used center before (whoops). If it was used in our code then by all means, go for it!    Hi Shannon!    Youre allowed to use those test cases but you should still write some of your own!     Nanaki  Hi Niki!      Unfortunately split can take a maximum of one parameter. If you want to split the puzzle via two different operators, you would need to split it twice.      Nanaki Hi Ashwin!    Yes you may use code from the course as long as you cite it, although we encourage writing it on your own :)     Nanaki Hi Chen!    Unfortunately using sort on a 2d list will not work the way you want because it will sort the lists based on their elements index by index.     For example if i have L = [[2,4],[1,5]], sorted(L) will give me [[1,5],[2,4]] because 1 is less than 2 at index 0. The sort will continue to the following indexes with all elements of L (which are all lists, since L is a 2d list), but it wont sort all the integers within L.     Hope this helps!     Nanaki <span style="background color:#fff">Yes    think about how Andrew found the distinct digits in isMagicSquare yesterday!</span>Hi Cynthia!    From the writeup: <span style="background color:#fff">returns a tuple of the highest scoring word in the dictionary that can be formed by some arrangement of some subset of letters in the hand, followed by its score. In the case of a tie, the first element of the tuple should instead be a list of all such words in the order they appear in the dictionary.</span>  <span style="background color:#fff"> </span>  Hope this helps!     Nanaki   <p dir="ltr">Hi Jiayu!  <p dir="ltr">  <p dir="ltr">Characters in the hand cant be used more than once to create words.  <p dir="ltr">  <p dir="ltr">Nanaki  Hi Rosie!      So as you can see in the writeup, a possible solution for the example given (SENDMORE=MONEY) had a solution OMY  ENDRS. In this case, only 8 distinct letters were used.      Hope this helps!      Nanaki  Hi Coral!      So according to the problem, you want to construct words using some arrangement of some subset of letters in the hand. That being said, the subset of letters you create must form words so in your example you could only form tell if you had two ls (because there is not another l in the subset).      Nanaki  Hey Tara!      If possible you should definitely go to OH to get this checked out in person. Theres probably some weird import or character that snuck itself in there that were missing. Could you post a screenshot of the whole autolab screen as a follow up (as in the screen that shows up when you click on your score)?      Nanaki  Hi Yudi!      So you looped through rows in range(8) and cols in range(4) to create the grid. Directly putting in those values is using magic numbers. Instead, you could set variables (e.g. rows, cols) equal to the number of rows and cols so you can loop in range(rows) (or cols, whatever is necessary).      Setting variables equal to the required values is eliminating the use of magic numbers because then your function isnt dependent on changing the magic numbers every time they appear (as in you would need to change 8 every time it appears if you wanted to change the number of rows to make the grid. If you wanted to change the rows the best way would be to have a rows variable and change its value to change the value of rows every time it appears in the problem).      Hope this helps!      Nanaki  technically yes! Hi Coral!    The 25 line limit only applies to the functions you write, so setting up the canvas in the run function (which is what im assuming youre talking about) would not apply to that.     Hope this helps!     Nanaki  So in this case, you want to write runSimpleTortoiseProgram to include the root setup and creates the canvas. Once you do that, you want to actually interpret the program string. To avoid going over 25 lines, writing a helper function to do the interpreting (i.e. drawing) Hey Supawat!    There unfortunately isnt a way to remove autolab submissions. We only count your last submission, so youll have to resubmit.      Nanaki  Hey Niki!      The next hw should be posted after the quiz sometime this evening :)      Nanaki  Hey Coral!      When you test your code against the test cases, what does it look like? Are you getting errors there?      Nanaki  So the \ns shouldnt matter but youre getting an error because your code is adding an extra new line at the beginning and end.  So the triple quoted string allows us to write a section of text on multiple lines. The first and last characters are G and a respectively. There is no new line at the beginning or end.  Sorry about that I misread the question!! Im glad you got it though :) youre right but were going to ignore the \n at the beginning and end for the sake of maintaining the pattern!  Hey Daphne!      Youre allowed to use all of those.       Nanaki Hi Kenan!    When summing the squares of digits, eventually youll either get 1 or a series of other numbers which are repeating (use the wikipedia page for happy numbers to see that). Using that knowledge you can write in code that will end the loop.      Nanaki    Hi Jiwon!      What version of python do you have downloaded? That may be the reason why youre getting errors.      Nanaki  when was the last time you updated your laptop? another student was having a similar issue the other day  Hi Coral!      Andrew answered this in post 19! Hope that helps!  Sorry about that!      Heres Andrews answer: When you round anything with a .5 at the end, it will round to the next largest integer value. So in this case, the next largest integer from  1.5 would be  1. So thattest caseis correct.  Hi Chen!      You can totally use any previous function as a helper function. kthDigit would be appropriate here.      You are also allowed to use abs().      Hope this helps!  Hi Mansi!      The best way to take care of these problems is to deal with cases. That is, consider the various types of inputs that could be accepted by these functions and use what we know so far(operators, conditionals, etc) to treat inputs based on the case into which they fall.      Hope this helps!
