 Hi Shannon,      Have you tried giving the full file path to the image? If that still doesnt work, can you try a couple different gif files?      Nikolai  Hi Shannon,      Although I cant explain exactly why, when you use l = [ ] as an optional parameter, it seems that the value doesnt not get reset to [ ] each time. It has something to do wth l already being defined in memory I believe. Can you think of a way to solve this without using that optional parameter?      Nikolai  Hi Rosie,      This assertion states that the object q1 needs to be both an instance of Quadratic AND and an instance of Polynomial.       Nikolai  Hi Anupam,      Part of the polynomial class problem includes writing the __mul__ function for class Polynomial. This hint is supposed to demonstrate the similarities between what__mul__ and __rmul__ are actually doing (they are in fact doing the exact same thing). The only difference is which function python decides to call.      See the following examples    In the first example, python will call the first Polynomials __mul__ function and pass the second one in as a parameter.   In the second example, python will call the first Polynomials __mul__ function and pass the integer 2 in as a parameter   But in the third example, python attempts to call the integer __mul__ method and pass your polynomial in as a parameter. This will fail because integers dont know how to deal with you class. Python will then attempt to call your Polynomials __rmul__ function and pass the integer in as a parameter. Assuming you have __rmul__ written properly, this should behavejust like example 2.      Hope that helps!    Nikolai  Hey guys,      Roman and I will be hosting a homework Review Session in Doherty A302 from 7 8. Well go over some sample solutions to Tetris and Snake andanswer any questions you might have. See you there!      Nikolai  Hi Kenan,      Your step function in this case is just timerFired. Each call to timerFired can be thought of as one step.      Nikolai Flowers  Im not aware of a method topreventthe functions frombeing called, but there is a way to control whether or not the code inside actually runs. Do you remember the method we used to pause animations from running? Can you think of a way to adapt that method for this purpose?  Youre on the right track here, but I suspect you might have a bug somewhere. Are you certain the values of data.paused or data.gameOver are correct?  Awesome, good luck!     Hi Niki,      Good job localizing your bug! I think you found the line your error is on. The keyError signifies that youre trying to access an element in a dictionary that doesnt as of yet exist (similar to an indexError for lists). Consider the value of the dictionary final on the first pass through the for loop. Final will still be an empty dictionary, but youre trying to access the key person...      Hope that helps!      Nikolai  Hi Jennifer,      So a keyError in dictionaries is very similar to an indexError for lists, it is raisedwhen youre trying to access an element that does not exist. I would look carefully at your friendsD (particularly the line where youre trying to add d[i]   d[j] to it) to make sure youre not trying to access a non existent key.      Your comment for the line seems to indicate that youre trying to add a new key and value to the dictionary. The syntax for that in dictionaries is d[newKey] = newValue.      Hope that helps!   Nikolai  Instead of thinking of it as excessive unproductive mental activity, you could look for ways to prove that your code has the best possible runtime for the question :)     Hi Kenan,      friendsOfFriends takes in a dictionary with each persons name stored as a key. The value stored at that key is theset of all of that persons friends. Youll return a similar structure, but instead of placingonly the set of friends in the dictionary, it should be the set of friends AND all of their individual friends.      Nikolai  Its up to you to interpret the questions and test your code accordingly.     Hi Chen,      The directions seem to specify that you use other methods for doing hw 4.1, so please avoid using sets and dictionaries for now.       Nikolai  Yes, since appendingto lists doesnt create a new list, L = [1] would be O(1). Appending to strings of O(N) because an entirely new string has to be created so you have to copy N elements over just to add 1.  Hi Kenan,      The difference between these two examples is that a is a 2d list in the destructive version and only 1d in the nondestructive. When we create b by slicing from a 2d list, we create an alias of a, so when we modify a well also be modifying b. When we slice from a 1d list, we simply copy the values from a to b, so changing b has no effect on a.      Hope that helps!   Nikolai  Thats a great question! The difference is that lists are mutable and objects are immutable. When you change a list, the address in memory stays the same and therefore youre simply modifying an already existing object. Ints work a little differently though, when you change them youre not actually modifying the value stored in memory, youre telling the variable to point to a new integer. So ints are like strings in that respect, they cant be changed.         Hi Coral,  We only do big O analysis on code that is actively running. If code follows a break or continue structure in a way that it never actually runs, we would not count it in our efficiency calculations. However, be careful that any code youre not counting doesnt run for any possible input.     For ex         In your first example, the for loop will still run N times regardless of whether or not c is in your charCount. Your second example is bit trickier... since there are only a finite number of characters you can put in a python string and the break statement ensures that you will exit the for loop upon seeing a duplicate, there is a maximum number of times this for loop can run, suggesting that this for loop could be constant time. Regardless of how big s is initially, the for loop can only loop as many times as there are legal characters so I would suggest that that for loop is in fact O(1).     So setting up myS will actually be O(N) instead of O(N^2). Since were copying the same string Ntimes, were only performing N operations. Elements dont have to be individually copied over from string to string like they do for lists. From a 112 standpoint I think its also best to say the for loop runs O(N), the reason being that the break statement will end the loop after we see a duplicate character, and we can guarantee there will be a duplicate no later than N elements into the string.         An example of why setting up myS is O(N)    Now for the for loop   Since we exit after we see a duplicate, we can take advantage of the fact that we know our string repeats after n elements         Yep, I believe so!  Wait, hang on, I forgot about something here. The line if c in result will also run in O(N), and since thats inside the for loop you do still end up with O(N^2) for the function.     Hi for this memory game do we need test functions for every single helper function and for our main? Im kind of confused how to write them for the playMemoryGame( ) etc.   thanks!!!! Hi Kenan,  Have a look through the documentation, I think it has everything youll need! https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_center.htm  NikolaiHi Yudi,  Within the try except structure, the only time you will enter the except segment of code will be if something within try is giving you an error. Have you tried debugging the try segment to see if there is an error?  NikolaiHi Yuqian,  Yep, thats it!  NikolaiYep, its the same as scrabble, to use a letter multiple times you would have to have multiple copies of that letter.Hi Coral,  Unless the problem specifically tells you that all lists will not be empty, you must take into account the possibility of a list being empty.  NikolaiThe problem statement gives you that if no words can be found in the given hand, your function should return None.Hi Neil,  Dont worry about etc1, thats just a testing folder. It wont affect your overall grade.  NikolaiHi Chen,  The only numbers that we dont consider magic are  2,  1, 0, 1, 2, and 10. Any numbers besides these need to be placed in well named variables.  NikolaiIf it works as expected then sure!  NikolaiHi Anthony,  1) Yes every case (single and double) quotes need to be considered  2) The second parameter in str.find specifies the index at which to start looking for the string you pass in. Therefore, the 1 says start looking at index 1, not skip the first time you see \\\  NikolaiHi Jennifer,  I notice your passing in x0, y0, x1, and y1 as parameters to create_rectangle. Have you tried printing the values of each of these variables with each iteration to make sure they are what you expect? If theyre not, I would look at how youre computing them for each value of i and x.  NikolaiHi Coral,  Yes, multi line strings can be inside the function parameter.  NikolaiHi Cristina,  Consider that range(8, 0,  1) gives you the values 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 but range(0, 8) gives you the values of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.   NikolaiHi Chen,  We dont require test functions for functions that only create graphical output. You will need a test function for your rgbString helper however.  NikolaiHi Kenan,  Try printing the solution and the result of your patternedMessage function side by side. You will see that the two strings are not equivalent, but I believe the output of your function is correct.  NikolaiFunctions that employ graphics or events can have up to 25 lines but we still encourage you to use helpers to keep functions as clear as possible.  NikolaiThis format corresponds essentially to module.variable. When you access string.whitespace, youre telling python to look for a variable named whitespace in the string module.  If youre still having issues with this code segment it might even caused by having a variable and module both named string (additionally its generally a good idea to name your variables according to what they hold, so you may want to reconsider the string name.  NikolaiHi Yudi,  Yes, you may use isinstance in this problem.  NikolaiHi Yudi,  This error message points to a mistake in your longestDigitRun function, particularly when the input parameter is 10. Make sure youre function return the appropriate values for each parameter.  NikolaiHi Coral,  Its possible that autolab is registering your variable reverse as an illegal token because the variable name is identical to the function call reverse(). Can you try renaming that variable?  NikolaiHi Chen,  Yes, you may use math.cos(x)  NikolaiHi Gracia,    It looks like one of the test cases might be triggering an infinite loop or otherwise hanging and not allowing the test function to finish. Make sure there are no cases or values of n that would cause your while loop to run indefinitely.     Nikolai         Hi Kenan,  Our TAs are here, just put yourself on the queue and well be there as soon as we can.  NikolaiHi Shannon,  I believe the autolab output is correct. Remember the negative sign is not part of the digit, for example the zeroth digit of  1 is 1.  NikolaiGreat! Hi Andrew,        The python linter is set to disallow the use of the built in round function. It functions a bit differently than the way we define round and the point on the homework problem is for you to write the function that conforms to our specifications.       Nikolai Autolab just calls the names of the function, so as long as the names are the same the order is not important.Hi Cristina,     EOF stands for end of file. Ive found that and EOF error is typically the result of mismatched parenthesis but it could also be triggered by other syntax errors. The error message mentions line 140, I would look at that line in your code and make sure everything is correct      Nikolai  Hmm. Do you get an error when running your code in an editor? Hi Eunice,    Unless otherwise stated, feel free to use the functions youve already written.      Nikolai  Hi Bryan,      Yes, unless otherwise stated feel free to use any function or helper you wrote for a different part of the homework.       Nikolai  Hi,   In sublime youll want to go to the tools menu option and click on build or you can use control b on Windows       Nikolai
