 yup!  Hey Aditya,      Based on your code, I am not sure whats happening. You can either go to OH tomorrow, reach out to your mentor, or post the code here on Piazza so I can have a closer look and try to help you (no guaranteed it would work) : )      Max  Hi Isabella,      When I ran the code on my computer, it works fine. Exactly when does it say maximum recursion depth?      Max  awesome!  Hello everyone,      TP3 deadline is coming in less than 30 hours, and I hope you are beginning to wrap up your projects! If you are still having troubles, please come to office hours so we can help you out.      You will want to have a careful look at what you will be submitting (Full list here ). Abig part of tp3 is the video to showcase your project. The video is extremely important for us to grade your projects, but it will also act as the source for other people (say, family and friends, and recruiters) to look at. Therefore, be sure to highlight in your video the features and functionalities and any other awesome parts of your project that you have been working so hard on.      An important point: dont neglect and procrastinate on the video! If you start making the video at 3pm on Sunday, it might cause more stress than you think (I might or might not have experience with that). You would want to have everything finished ideally by tonight so you can start making the video tomorrow morning. Worst case, please have the coding finished by 10 a.m, and start making the video right after. We really really hope we wont see anyone fixing a major bug at OH tomorrow.      Anyway, here are some of thevideoscreen recording software tools we recommend:      QuickTimes New Screen Recording feature is highly recommended and by far the easiest option for Mac users. Its built in, and provides high quality recordings with minimum learning curve. Tutorialhere . This one is endorsed by Professor Kosbie as he uses it for the notesvideosScreencast O Maticis good for both Mac and Window . Super simple to use, and just works. You can publish directly to Youtube (good for that last minutevideo!). It does not offer in app editing, but you can save to your computer and edit from there if you like. Download linkhere .Camtasiaon Mac and Windows comes with a 1 month free trial. As a professional editing studio, Camtasia is extremely powerful, yet easy to use. Its features includeadding music, photos, effects, transitions, and text.It can also recordyou speaking into the microphone and what your computer is playing at the same time, making it good for musicprojects.Its also highly recommended if you wish to do a lot of fancy editing. Downloadhere .Be careful with this one; everything is great at first but after a month it breaks your heart and asks for money. Jing on Mac and Windows is made by the same company as Camtasia, but is much more lightweight. Its less full featured buteasier to use. This program is free, so if youve already used your Camtasia free trial, this is a good option. However, it does attach a watermark tovideos, and also tries to be easy to access but just ends up being annoying. Downloadhere .    Please contact your mentor or go to office hours if you run into any issues. Good luck wrapping up the term projects and we are extremely excited to them : )      Best,   Max  Zoe   did you figure it out? Images in tkinter are unpredictable...      Max  Hi Yudi,      MVP for tp would be a low B level project. An example (for this summer) would be like this one, perhaps with a nicer UI and different levels of AI:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c4ozVI7Ujg       Hope that helps!   Max  Hi Bryan,      Yes! Please see 484      Max  Hello everyone,      I hope everyone is making good progress with their term projects. Since TP3 is due at 5pm this Sunday, we are having OH 2 5pm for both Saturday and Sunday to help you wrap up your projects. You can also pick up your midterms during OH on Saturday      I will make a separate post about options to make videos : )   Max  Hi Tara,      Sorry for the late response! Dont know if you have seen this before, but if you havent hopefully this will help:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2957116/make 2 functions run at the same time       Max  Hi Zoe,      Here is a link that could potential help you:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17417467/python text input within a tkinter canvas       Looks like there are 2 ways of handling it: canvas.create_windows, or entry widget .pack() function. Try both and please come to OH if it doesnt work!      Hope that helps,   Max  Mansi   yes, it is possible, and its also done : )      Max  Hello everyone,      Attached is the practice exam 2 for your studying pleasure. A reminder that you should print out your own copy if you are attending the mock practice exam.      PracticeExam2.pdf       Have fun studying !   Max  Hi Jennifer,      Were you able to go to OH and get help? Otherwise, this looks like the problem with where you put your sampleFiles folder. Try placing your solution file in the same directory as the sampleFiles folder. If you have tried that and it doesnt work, then well need to look in person.      Max  When I ran your code on my computer in the same folder, it has a different error. Perhaps you might have 2 different solution files at different locations? Try opening and run the one in the same folder as the sampleFiles. This is the error I am getting    But this has more to do with the logic of the code.  Hi Yudi,      You can avoid .DS_Store by following instructions on this post 447.      Hope that helps!   Max  Hey Anthony,      You need to write test cases for findLargestFile, just like any other functions. Something like this    I would recommend looking at the recitation file to see more.      Hope that helps,   Max  Hello everyone,      In preparation for exam 2 this coming Wednesday, we are offering the following events, all on  Sunday, June 25th. A few notes:  We will be reviewing sets and dicts, Animations, OOP, and recursion.Since homework 5.2 is due tomorrow, we are offering  Office Hours from 2   7 pm on Saturday, June 24th .We will post the practice exam after the homework is due. Please bring your own copy if you plan to go to the mock practice exam.     Let me know if you have any questions, and have fun studying! Almost there : )   Max  Hi Shannon,      That looks good tome! As for an example of shouldnt directly modifying the objects means, if you separate your solution into 3 major parts: Bird class, Obstacle class, and Animation part that ties everything together, thenyou shouldnt do Bird.cy  = Bird.gravity in the Animation timerFired. Instead, you should do what you are exactly doing: have a move function within the Bird class, and call that move function in the animation part.      Hope that helps!   Max. Memoization. Memorization callWithLargeStack.Recursion Yup, as long as you only use recursion and no iteration : )      Max  Hello everyone,      Same as last week: week5 review session will take place in DHA302 from 7   8:30pm. We are covering OOP and recursion . Come with questions!       Max  What method doesnt take in self?  .static method.__init__.__hash__.__repr__.all of the above Anthony   We will be grading each part separately : )      Max  Hi Yudi!      timerFired is the function that is affected by the timer.I cant tell you where you should put it, but wherever you put it you probably need to check if the third piece of food has been eaten.      If that doesnt help, please come to OH and elaborate more on Piazza to clarify your question : )   Max Have you thought about what you are going to do for your Term Project?  .no idea .Yes! I am going to write a computer vision app that uses 100 layers of convolutional neural nets.Others Hi Anthony   please put all the test functionsand manual grading below the ignore rest line. Its in the homework description.  Hello everyone,      Since this Friday is going to be a normal lecture (we have quite a bit of materials needed to be cover), we will be having  week 4 review session  tomorrow , Thursday June 15th from 7   8:30 pm in DHA302  (normal lecture hall). We will be reviewing sets, dictionaries, and animations. Dont worry if you cant make it, we will be releasing the practice quiz afterwards.      In addition, for your planning purposes,  week 4 homework solution session  will be on  Monday, June 19th from 7   8pm, also in DHA302 .      Good luck with hw 4.1!   Max  Rosie   there might be a better way that I am not aware of, but for loops should do fine. Like Nanaki said, the problem is really how you manipulate the angles using math. I would recommend using pen and paper to draw the wheel and the coordinates and the angles out, maybe that can give you some insights : )  Hey Kenan,      You will learn more about it during Object Oriented Programming part of the course, but to give you a snippetclass Struct(object) creates a class, then you call Struct() to create an objectto store all your data, or your model information.      Hope that helps!   Max   Yup, you can ignore that.      Max  Which of the following games/entertainment would you enjoy the most?  .Tetris (you will write this!).Snake (we will write this, most likely).Netflix (someday, in the future, you can develop this. You just gotta believe) Hey Kenan,      We taught you Big Oh precisely to answer this question! Instead of us telling you the answer, can you figure it out yourself? Hint: looping through stuff is usually O(N).      Try out yourself first and let us know what you think! Good exercise.      Hope that helps,   Max  Hi Jiayu   yup, you are allowed to use those : )      Max  Why are a lot of Set/Dictionary methods more efficient than List methods?  .Because of hashing.Because of dark magic.Hashing, which is a type of dark magic Can we take a 5 min break 50 minutes into the class?      Concentration deteriorates otherwise.  Hey Kenan   Possibly, with the poll : )  Hi Kam!      The practice exam solutions will not be posted. Come to the solution session if you can : )      Max  Hello everyone,      Here is the practice exam 1. Thanks to our wonderful TAswho worked hard to put them together! Note that we do offer thethe mock practice exam session where you will be taking the practice exam in a proctored setting. If you do decide to attend, please bring your own copy!      PracticeExam1.pdf       Have fun studying : )   Max  Hi everyone,      Just a note that if you are using a grace day for hw 3.3, you cant come to the solution session tonight. We will also be taking attendance to enforce that.      Good luck with hw 3.3!   Max  If you come to lecture a little early tomorrow (8:50 ish), we might or might not have a little surprise for you : )  We will be manually grading this so no autoscore. Reminder that you have total of 4 submissions!      Max  Hi Eunice,      This is an example of a design choice that you will have to make. We only say that we wont test board with rows and cols are greater than 26, otherwise it is up to you. So if you assume the rows and cols are positive integers, state so in your comment/help command. If you want to restrict user input, have some sort of mechanism such that when rows cols are negative, the game prints invalid (or something similar).      Hope that helps!   Max  Yuqian   if you didnt return anything, make sure your function prints correctly on the console (just by looking at it) and that would be fine   Hey Yuqian,      Recall that solvesCryptarism takes 2 input: puzzle and solution. So if your puzzle is SENDMORE=MONEY and solution isOMY  ENDRS, that means O has value 0, M has value 1, Y has value 2, E has value 5, and so on.      Hope that helps! Also, you should pay attention in lecture ;)   Max  Which option would you have for breakfast? Just curious.  .Panera Bread (Bagel and coffee).Cereal.What is a breakfast? Hi Jennifer,      From the write up: In the case of a tie, the first element of the tuple should instead be a list of all such words in the order they appear in the dictionary.      SoI would recommend having something like a current score and a best score, similar to what we did in mostCommonNames problem in recitation. And so when your current score is equal to your best score, you add the name to your best namelist. Otherwise, your best name is just a tuple.      Hope that helps! If you are still confused, please come to OH so we can talk to you : )   Max  Come if you want to see how we solve topLevelFunctions! (and other problems) Hi Mansi,    You dont have to write test functions for functions that take in a canvas as a parameter. Otherwise you are required to write test functions for all the rest.     Hope that helps!  Max Hi Daphne,    Either way is fine, but we would recommend doing it with a main function like in last hw : )     Max Hi Suraj,    The link is herehttp://www.kosbie.net/cmu/spring 14/15 112/handouts/hw3.html      Max  Hi Ben,      It is on the link. If you scroll down to problem 6, Simple Encryption, you will see encrypt as part A of the problem : )      Hope that helps,   Max Hi Ben   No worries! The link is herehttp://www.kosbie.net/cmu/spring 14/15 112/handouts/hw3.html  Soonafter the quiz : )      Max  Hey Aditya,      Integer division will come in handy here : )      Max  Ah thats fine; if it looks like you are moving from black to white then thats good enough.  Hey Niki!      Whenever your code doesnt pass the test case and you cant spot the bug immediately, I would recommend using the good old friend print at various locations of your code and use the power of pen and paper to code trace. Try print your result before you return, variable final and elementafter each iteration and see if thats what you expected.      I know its not an easy process, but its a tremendously useful skills, to be able to debug your own code.      Let me know what progress you made and come to OH!   Max  Hi Kenan,      I think you got the right idea in your title hex. Its converting the number red, green, and blue from decimal into hex format. And a string of hex will return a color.      If you are interested, you can google and get this:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3380726/converting a rgb color tuple to a six digit code in python       Note that these type of questions you can easily google and get the answers. As you probably know its a useful skill to try and answer your own questions before coming to us : )      Cheers,   Max  Hi Yudi,      My suggestion would be have some sort of ways (a variable, for example) to keep track of the first time you see a quote. Then, as you loop through the input, if you encounter another quote, you can use that variable to determine which part of the inputyou would need to take out. More concretely, if I have a variable named start initialized at 0, whenever I encounter an quote, if start is 0 I know its the start of a quote, and if it is not I know its the end of the quote. In addition, if you encounter a # and start is 0, you also know that # is not within any quote.      Think about that for a bit, let me know what progress you have made, and come to OH : )   Max  you dont need test functions for graphic function that takes in a canvas as a parameter. However, if you have a helper function that, for example, calculate the coordinates, then you will need test functions for that.      For other problems, I think you meant 5 test cases for each test functions? Yes, that sounds good : )   Max  I dont think you need to care about return. Consider this case    the output of the above example should be f.g, since # makes the return anthony and return max obsolete.  Hi Anthony  lets try to figure out yourself if theres any bug first. Use print statement to confirm your suspicion if any.One of the most useful skills we are trying to teach you is to figure out the bug yourself. In the real world, there will probably be no TA to look for your bug : )      Well talk again after you have tried to debug yourself. Come to OH if needed!  Hey Zhao   nice catch! You can use string.splitlines(), but not string.splitlines()[0], since like you said it is list indexing.  Shenhan   in this  specific problem,  we only care if the function is defined and not returning, because the problem will be unnecessarily over complicated if we care about it returning. So like Roman said, we just need to determine and return the functions that are defined within that code. I suggest keep to that definition of top level function  for this problem only .      Let me know ifthat clears things up : )  You dont need test cases for any functions that take in and use canvas. Other than that, if you have a graphic helper functions that, for example, calculate the coordinates, then yes you will need a helper function.      Hope that helps!   Max  \, , #, tabs, newline, commas would be considered examples of string delimiters. If you are interested you can find out more herehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter        Hope that helps!   Max  Hey Nikita,      Ignoring the comment for sure. As for the #supabeast, since it is within the string, we will ignore the string and not just the #supabeast, i.e. ignore Roman is a #supabeast      But he is a supabeast, so in real life we should not ignore Roman the supabeast: )  Hey Suraj,      You can assume its a regular cutoffs, i.e. 90 for an A, 80 for a B, 70 for a C, 60 for a D. There might or might not be a curve, but dont bet on it : )      Max  Hey Kenan!      Notice that you are adding a to string in your loop, whereas I think you meant to add i. If you add a, you will add the same string every time, hence getting that result.      Hope that helps!   Max  Hi Judi,      When you do pattern.splitlines(), the subPattern you created does not include newline character. Thats why your result is all in one line. If you simply loop through the pattern, then the newline characters will stay where they are and you can add them as normal.      Hope that helps!   Max  Not exactly. The problem is not in whether you are printing or returning, its in the line    the subPattern you created here will not contain any newline, because splitlines method gets rid of all the newline characters. If you want to retain those newline characters, you can combine your nested for loop    into one loop by looping through each character in the pattern without using pattern.splitlines, and adding this character like you are already doing.      Let me know if that clears up or makes it more confusing : )  Ah I see. You would almost always want to return a value in a function. That \n I assume is because you still have leading and trailing newlines. The problem statement says that any leading or trailing newlines in the pattern are removed. So, you might want to remove those leading and trailing newlines, and you wont see the \n again!  Actually, that looks like what you want! Dont worry about the whitespaces inside the message; they are supposed to remain there. Theres no difference (as far as I know of) between    and       Dont worry about too many questions   questions are great, keep them coming : )  Hello everyone,      We will be having hw1 solution session today (Tuesday, 05/30) from  7 8pm in DHA302  (where we usually have lecture). The main focus will be hw1.4 problems.      Hope to see some of you there!   Max  Yup, its todays!    .7 8pm.7:30   8:30pm. Hi Kenan,    You have the high level idea right: you want to remove the first character of the string while the string starts with a space, and similarly remove the end while it ends with a space. However, notice that you start and end variables change with every iteration of the loop. So after the first iteration, start = 1, so you correctly do s[1:len(s)]. But the next iteration, start = 2, then your new s will be s[2:len(s)]. Is that what you want, or s[1:len(s)] is what you want? Similar idea for end variable as well.     To clarify a bit further, it would make sense to do what you did if s doesnt change. However, notice how you assign s = s[start:len(s)] every time, so s in fact does change : )     Let me know if that makes sense!  Max   Hi Cristina   I would suggest going to Office Hours today so we can take a closer look at your code. A lot of times it could be an error somewhere else in the file that affects it. Hi Zoe,      k can be larger than the number of digits in n. In fact, one of our test cases (sort of) addresses that:    so you can imagine if k = 4 in the abovetest case, the output will be 10468.      Let me know if that helps!   Max  Hi Chen,      The registration code is 112rocks. Let me know if that works!      Max If it works thats fine : ) Hi Cristina,      It turns out that autograder cannot readany file with non ascii characters and thus automatically give you a zero. In your case, its the little symbol on your name. If you take that character out, everything will be fine. Please let me know if theres still issue : )       Hope that helps!   Max  Hey Jennifer   Autolab shows me that I have enrolled you. Did it show you any error when you tried to log in?        We are working on it   thanks for letting us know Jennifer!Try acessing it again now and let me know if you still have problems : )
