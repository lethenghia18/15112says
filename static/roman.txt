 Hello Yudi!      Working demo means just a demonstration of the basic functionality of your code   so whatever code you have up to this point!      Hope this helps!      Roman  Hello Vidya!      Have you considered having a lockedDown list with tuples corresponding to the (row, col) of the elements you dont want to be overwritten?       Roman:)  Hello Everybody!      Just a reminder about the practice exam proctoring happening right now in DH A302 (for those of you who were here earlier, the noise has died down!).      Also, for those thatd like to see the solutions, well be going over them beginning at 4:30 PM, also here in DH A302.      Thanks for your time!       Roman  Hello Isabella!      Are you sure that the sampleFiles folder containing folderA is within your desktop? Ive tested this on my pc, and Im not getting this error       Roman:)  Hello Niki!     Im sorry for the delay! Im not 100% either way, but have you considered the possibility that your largestFile is initialized to the empty string, and so the first time you call os.path.getSize(largestFile), youd get this error because largestFile is ? The main reason I ask this is because it appears as though the error is on the line where the code above is called.      If this doesnt do it feel free to follow up! Also,try printing largestFile and path before that line and seeing their values, as it seems one of them is the empty string      Let me know!      Roman        Hello!      Forgrading questions like this, please email kdchinandrew.cmu.edu and he should be able to clear up any confusions.      Hope this helps,      Roman  Hello Christina!      We dont give out code we type in recitation, but are happy to go over any solutions we did during OH if that would help!      Sorry,      Roman  Hello Anupam!      I responded to another student with the following yesterday, I hope it helps!      According to google, __rmul__ is called in the following situation:      When two objects are multiplied, python tries to call the left objects __mul__ method. However, if that method doesnt exist, then python tries calling __rmul__ on the right object, and the reason it uses __rmul__ instead of __mul__ for the right object is because it wants to inform the right object that it is actually the right operand instead of the left. (Info fromhere )      As for exponentiation, try __pow__().         Roman Hello Christina!  If you have made a function that takes in a number and returns the sum of its divisors recursively, can you think of a way to use that as a helper to isPerfectNumber?  Note that you can use helpers provided theyre recursive and arent iterative  I hope this helps,  Roman Hello Yuqian!      Id say so:)       Roman  Hello Yudi!      For your first question, have you considered the __eq__() method?      And for your second, Id say youre correct. Id try putting the almostEqual() method in my code and that should avoid that error.      Good skill,      Roman  Hello Yudi, sorry for the delay!     This may be obvious, but have you tried running the test cases given by the problem statement? And that first error didnt occur?  Hello Rosie!      Youre totally welcome to use whatever helpers youd like, as long as they, too, are recursive!      Roman:)  Hello Kenan!      Max recursion depth is indeed a thing of concern for certain cases   however, for my implementation of recursive isPerfectNumber(), though I get a max recursion depth right around the numbers you do, it passes the test cases on autolab (just checked)!      Thanks for the question!      Roman  Hello Daphne!      That seems like a reasonable approach!Another thing to note is (1) that a given bird likely has certain properties that make it unique/describe it (like the things we normally wouldve put in our animation init, but now we will put into our Bird class init); and, (2), that by not directly changing attributes, it means not directly calling the bird objects attributes outside of the class, but instead making methods that interact with the birds attributes.      As an example, instead of saying:    The instructions would prefer something like:       Hope this helps!      Roman  Hello Mansi!      According to google, __rmul__ is called in the following situation:      When two objects are multiplied, python tries to call the left objects __mul__ method. However, if that method doesnt exist, then python tries calling __rmul__ on the right object, and the reason it uses __rmul__ instead of __mul__ for the right object is because it wants to inform the right object that it is actually the right operand instead of the left. (Info from here )      As for exp, try __pow__(). After some googling I think thats what it is:)      Hope this helps!      Roman  Hello Vidya!      By snakemoves, they mean the times the head of the snake moves to a new cell (note that the head of the snake doesnt move while the game is paused, but that doesnt mean that the snakemoves should reset)      Hope this helps:)      Roman  Hello Yudi!      Timer fired!      Thanks,      Roaman  Hello Kenan!      Id recommend coming to OH, as wegenerally dont confirm code via piazza!       Roman:)  Good stuff!  Hello Anupam!      Since its part of the animation problem, it can be up to 25 lines. If that isnt enough, remember that you can always define a helper function that takes in data and initializeswhatever you need it to and call that helper within your init!      Hope this helped:)      Roman Hello Supawat!  So the pieces eventually become a part of the board once they get to the bottom (not sure if you read ahead to that). Id recommend skimming the entire set of instructions to get a high level idea of the plan and that may help, but, if you really dont want to follow it, feel free to implement your own spin on the instructions!  Good skill:)  RomanHello!  By level, they mean either the end of level 1 (after three pieces of food have been eated by the snake), the end of level 2 (which would be the end of the game), or the end of the game during level 1 also.   For your second question, it means 20 moves while avoiding the wall.  And for your final question, it means you shouldnt overwrite a wall while placing a food or poison!  I hope this helps, and good skill implementing:)  Roman Hello Jiayu!      To your first question, yes. And to your second question, also yes!      Hope this helps:)      Roman  Hello Chen!      Just one poison is necessary!       Roman  Hello Coral!     According to the problem statement, Level 2 (when one piece of poison shows up randomly and the game speed increases), should begin as soon as the snake eats the third piece of food.      Hope this helps,      Roman  According to the problem statement, it does not!       Roman:)  Hello Kenan!      I just looked it up, and it appears to exist simply as a view of the dictionary you input to dict.items.      Interestingly, it updates dynamically as you update the dictionary!      I bet you could google why people use this, because I have no idea      Hope this helps,      Roman:)  Correct! (But only for sets, as you noted).  A representative example of the difference between shallow/deep copying would bethe following:    After this, a, b, and c would be the following (in order):    But as you noted below, since you cant have a mutable element in a set (like the list above), the shallow/deep copy difference is negligible when it comes to sets.  Also, you could try looking at the line above or for a function preceding this line of the form below, as those have a way of giving these types of errors!       note that in this case the error occurs because of improper indentation as Nanaki noted, just not on the line in question (per se)  Hello Kenan!      We dont generally post solutions for any problems other than examples in the course notes, but if you come down to OH any of our TAs would be happy to go over the solution with you in person:)      Roman Hello Vidya!  Id check your bounds checker and make sure it looks good for your data.dir situation, and I dont really know whats up with your vertices/direction, but you could try printing the data.dir variable at various places around where your vertices change, and hone down on precisely where dir is changing when you dont wish it to  Hope this helps, and dont forget about OH today for specific debugging help if the steps I mentioned dont help:)  RomanHello Rosie!  Id recommend googling it, and checking out the description in the python documentation. It may not give precisely the runtime, but it describes the algorithm, which should sound familiar to something youve seen before and know the runtime of!  Good learning opportunity:)    Roman Hello Yudi!      A helpful dictionary method for key errors is .get(), which takes as its second (and optional) parameter a value which it will return if the key in the first paramater isnt in the dictionary in question.      Perhaps this could be helpful for dealing with thiserror?       Roman:)  I dont know if this is necessarily it, but youre removing the name from fofSet, which doesnt look to be a dictionary  I agree it does seem to be an odd error, since I cant think of a case of fof as I understand it that would cause it, but a surefire way to fix it would be with a simple if statement before you remove name from fofSet, if that makes sense.  Im confident in your ability to troubleshoot! (To point you in the right direction of finding your answer, are there any test cases you might be able to input to re create the error in your initial code, and then test that alongside your new code?)      This is a good learning opportunity!      :)  Correct! [Edit: values should be sets, not lists, but other than that correct (third edit: Now its totally correct!)]      Good stuff,      Roman  Hello Suraj!      First, is your run function below the ignore all comment line? If so, let us know and well check this out right away!      Thanks,      Roman  Hello Yuqian!      You should indeed return a set, so your second response! (If this was your question)      Hope this helps,      Roman  Hello Kenan!      It looks to me like your calculations are correct (though your function takes in no input, but if a were the input and all the other variables were of the same length as a, then youd be correct!)      Good stuff,      Roman  Sorry, but we feel this would be unfair!      Good skill!      Roman  Sorry man!  In terms of format, looks good Kenan!       Roman  Hello Shenhan!      For any function you write, its always a good idea to test it to ensure it works as you expect it to!       Roman:)  Hello Coral!      It does actually require N work because its making a new shallow copy of itself and appending to that new list the element 1!      Roman  Hello Niki!      Id recommend attending OH ( till 10 PM tonight in gates) to go over the hw!      Roman  Hello Kenan!      The problem statement says that kaprekar numbers are nonnegative integers, but not that the inputs to the function will be non negative!      Roman  Hello Zoe!      This is a good question! Id recommend googling exactly the invalid literal for int() with base 10... error, and, if you dont find anything useful, try putting the following line into your python shell and seeing the error that pops up:       I hope this helps!      Roman:)  Hello Zoe!      You should have 8 submissions for this hw!      Roman:)  Hello Kenan!      By number of digits, we meant to say the number of digits that make up the <span style="text decoration:underline">representation</span> of the number, so, since theres one 1 and two 0s, which make three digits!      Does this answer your question?  Let me backtrack a little bit here Kenan, Im sorry if I only indirectly answered your first question      In the initial post, you note that N generally refers to the size of our input. So, for a string, N refers the the characters in that string, for a list, N refers to the elements in the list, etc.      However, in the case of integer inputs, there is more than one possible interpretation for the size of the input, as you note in your point no. 2. So, by one definition, youre absolutely right that the size of our input for an integer, say 358, should be the value of our input, or 358 (see A below). However,for functions that iterate through the digits of 358 (see the example code B below), the relevant information isnt directly the value of the input, but rather the number of digits that make up the number.      Code A, representing the case in which a function taking in integer inputs runs in O(n) [bigO of little n] time       Code B, representing the case in which a function taking in integer inputs runs in O(N) [bigO of big N] time          So, while N in general refers to the size of our input, we make the distinction between little n and big Nprecisely because of your initial point, no.2, regarding integers; so we should have two separate ways of handling integer inputs: little n to represent when were referring to the value of a number, and big N to represent when were referring to the number of digits a number contains.      So, while 101 and 999 have very different little n values, their big N, 3, is the same.      Does this clear up the confusion?       Roman  Answer below:)  Hello!      I dont know if this is the fix necessarily, but try considering when the input is a float if you havent already!      Hope this helps:)      (If it doesnt help come to OH!)      Roman  Hello Daphne!      Consider the case where the input n is a float!      Hope this helps,      Roman  It does indeed mean it isnt efficient enough!  Hello Kenan!      The problem statement is correct here, mainly because if you guess 8, and they say its less, then it cant be 8 going forward (so its greater than 4 and less than 8, exclusively), and is therefore either 5, 6, or 7.      I hope this clears up any confusion!    Roman  Answer below:)  Hey Bryan!      You were right all along! It does indeed run n^2 (Max and Kyle have guided me to the correct answer, so thank them when you see em!)      Thanks,      Roman  Hello Tanvi!      In the worst case, insert takes O(n) time (when the index given is the 0th, because it then has to move every other element over by one).      Hope this answers your question satisfactorily!      Roman  Hello Shannon!      You should use test functions for all of the helper functions you can, specifically the ones making your boards (by ensuring that a given random board has exactly two of all the desired digits)! Though of course for your main function there is no explicit test function possible, so all the testing can be done by just playing the game      I hope this helps!     Roman  Hello Yudi!     In general, the try except format is as follows when taking in user input          I hope this helps!      Roman  Consider why we have our while loop true. Does the while loop continue for as long as the game is going? If so, how do we get to the next step of the game?      If I understand your code correctly, it looks like you want to continually get the users input and do something with it (which youre in the process of implementing).      In order to do this continually, dont you have to have it somewhere in your loop? Otherwise, youd keep on looping with the same value for coordinates.      I hope this helps!      Roman:) Hello Yudi!  Id recommend looking up the random module for python, and looking over the functions that it offers!  Hope this helps,  RomanHello Cristina!  This error is foreign to me personally, and generally these types of errors are hard to address via piazza. Would you be able to come to OH tomorrow to the bottom of it?  Thanks,  RomanHello Coral!  On an call to the function, a random board should be generated as part of the function!  I hope this helps!  Roman Hello Jennifer!      It seems you understand the problem perfectly with the only exception being the scores of the letters, as those are given to you.      So, instead of the scores of the letters corresponding to their index in the alphabet, the scores of the letters correspond to their index in the letterScores list (the 0th elem of letter scores tells the score of a, the 1st elem tells the score of b, and so on).      I hope this helps!      Roman  Hello Nikita!      Looks like you forgot the colon after your function definition of runSimpleTortoiseProgram()!      Hope this helps!      Roman  Hello Zhao!      Consider the barebones framework in the notes to create an empty canvas:             In this example, note how the runDrawing() function doesnt take in canvas as a parameter, but instead creates the canvas and root, and then passes the canvas off to a helper, in this case draw(), that actually does all the work with drawing and whatnot.      Then, since we want to take in a string of commands as well as a width and height, consider how you could alter the above framework to accommodate that!      Hope this helps (and sorry for the delay!),      Roman Hello Cynthia!  The question in question is labeled as number 6 in the link, as Simple Encryption [20 pts]  Hope this helps!  Roman Looks like you might have the link that was posted before it was updated! Sorry about that! Try this one! Hello Shenhan!  Dont worry about it! It was just some administrative autolab test (or something haha)!  Hope this quells your worries! #noWorriesAboutaThing  Roman Hello Chen!      To answer your question, Id consider if its possible for lookAndSay to output non positive values like 0 or  1. Since it shouldnt, and this function is the inverse of that function (so it takes inputs from what lookAndSay would possibly output), Id say no!      Hope this helps!      Roman Thank you very much for the notice! Professor Rudina is on it:) Hello Yudi!      I do not know! You can send any questions regarding grading to kdchinandrew.cmu.edu , the assistant head TA!      Hope this helps,      Roman:)  Hello Kenan!      Because they escape the non executing portion of the string to briefly perform the commandthat follows the escape character in question!      Hope this helps,      Roman  Hello Kenan!      This will make more sense when we explicitly go over classes, but you could consider attributes as functions or values that belong to or operate on a specific data type. So, in the example above, the __iadd__ attribute is a function that takes in the object its operating on (the list itself, which is before the =) as well as the thing being added to it (the thing following the =) and adds the element to the original list altered (since = destructively modifies the list).      In a more general sense, an attribute, like the definition of the word itself, is something that is unique to a particular datatype or user defined class (more on that later in the course), whether that be some stored value or a function that operates on the values of the type they belong to.      If this seems too confusing, hopefully this  video on the course website helps a little bit!      Hope this helps:)      Roman  Hey Coral!      Id check out this , which says that the % operator, when given % as an argument, just returns a single %!      Hope this helps!      Roman        Hello!      Sure it could! But I wouldnt worry about that being a special case or anything (not that you were)      Thanks,      Roman  Hello Isadora!      This question is one that ate at me as a student too! Id recommend you take out a piece of paper and draw the grid, and then, for each cell, write in its center the row, col combo it corresponds to. So the top left cell would be (0, 0), its neighbor below would be (1, 0), its neighbor to the right would be (0, 1), and so on.      Once you have them all written, Id recommend comparing the row, col coordinates to the cells that are white or black, and see if you can see a pattern! Its kind of neat!      Hope this helps,      Roman     Hello Bryan!      Id recommend you check out this  section of the notes!      Hope this helps!      Roman  Hey Rosie!      In general, anything not explicitly addressed in the problem statement for graphics questions is up to your discretion! So, to answer your question, it doesnt have to be exactly like what the proposed image looks like (as far as stylistic choices), but you do have to ensure that all the same elements are there!      Hope this helps,      Roman  No you do not!      (Sounds like you already did, but just make sure to comment above the functions you cite that youre citing them please!)  Hello Tara!      Looks like you didnt close the parentheses around the argument to your topLevelFunctionNames call in your test functions. Try putting a right parenthese (idk the singular lol) before the double equals sign!      Hope this helps,      Roman  When trying to answer this question, Id recommend you consider what you would do if given a sheet of paper with the code inside a triple quote.      Specifically, the following questions.   Once you see a triple quote, what do you do? At what point is the triple quote no longer a concern? How do you treat the stuff inside the triple quotes?      Since you already know the answer to the last question in code, its now all about figuring out the first two, and alsoaccounting for the fact that the triple quotes occur on multiple lines, rather than the single quotes that you only had to account for on a single line.      I dont want to say much more for fear of depriving you of a learning opportunity, but I hope this helped!      Roman  Hello Cristina!      Id recommend considering how the numbers in a given cell correspond to the row and column they are in, and see if you can make a formula that determines the number corresponding to a cell when given its row and column. If you had this formula, would it help you?      What would be the pros of finding such a formula? If you could find it, would you have to change any loops in your code?      Sorry to leave you with some questions, but hopefully it can serve as a good learning experience!      Good skill,      Roman     Hello Shenhan!      What this function wants you to do is, when given a string of some python code, determine and return the functions that are  defined  within that code (while still following the rules of python, like ignoring commented lines and not defining functions that are within quotes).      For example, consider the following code       So topLevelFunctions of the above string would return something.somethingElse, because it ignores the commented line and the function within the string!      Hope this helps!      Roman  You got it Kenan!      Here you go       So, in the code above, the isCool function should not be considered as a function name because its within a string, but the someFunction function should be.      I hope this helps!      Roman Hello Jennifer!  Single and double quotes are identical, while triple quotes allow you to put line breaks within the string.  I hope this helps!   Roman Hello Nikita!      The emboldened bit is correct as it is written!      For example, consider the following code       In this code, the #supabeast isnt a comment, because its within the string, but theother hashtag is a comment!      I hope this helps,      Roman  Hello Rosie!      I dont know! But if you do, itll likely be short!      Sorry I cant help!      Roman  Hello Shenhan!      Dont sweat it, the autoscore column is all you have to worry about for this hw!      And, for your second question, we only consider the last hw you submit!      Hope this helps, and Im sorry for the delay in responding!      Roman  Hello Yudi!      When they say rotation, they mean moving the last digit to the front      So the possible rotations of 213 (when ignoring the implicit leading zeros) are:      213   &gt; 321   &gt; 132   &gt; 213 ... (notice that 123 cant be created by doing this)      I think you thought they meant just jumbling up the numbers to recreate the first argument, but thats not how we meant the problem.      Hope this helps!      Roman  Hello Vidya!     Although you can alter the iterating variable (in this case i) within the loop, as soon as the loop restarts, the iterating variable will go to the next value it wouldve gone to anyway, regardless of what you reset it to in the loop.      Since what youwant to do is make the change you make to the variable stick (and not be meaningless once the loop goes into the next iteration), you may want to ask yourself is whether or not the index variable has to be the same as the iterating variable.      Hope this helps!      Roman  Hello Aisha!      For the toUpper and toLower functions, we want to only make the alphabetic characters uppercase/lowercase, and ignore the non alphabetic characters altogether!      I hope this helps,      Roman  Hello Anthony!      All the things you mentioned there are allowed! Every otherbuiltin function for strings (and string module functions) are not allowed!      Hope this helps,      Roman  Hello!      By that, they mean that the empty string is before and after abc, as well as between each letter.      Hope this helps!      Roman  Hello Anthony!      Firstly, the problem is supposed to be done entirely with numbers. You seem to understand all the necessary digit manipulations in the code you posted above, so that shouldnt be too hard to adjust!      However, when it comes to using currNumber,Id recommend you remember the solution we went over in recitation, where wefind the longestDigit as we go through the number, and try to extend it to this case! (So basically go through the number, remembering your currDigit and prevDigit as you go, and if theyre the same you wanna do something and check some things, and if theyre different you want to do something else)      I hope this helps!     Roman  Id recommend code tracing, and considering what the len(1)   1 evaluates to!      Hope this helps!      Roman      P.S. Remember that the range(start, end) goes up to but not including the end parameter!  Hello Vidya!      Since the char is presumably a lower case letter, and the lower case letters have higher ASCII values than the upper case ones,I think you mean to actually subtract the distance from the lower case letter to yield the upper case.      I hope this helps!      Roman  Hello Nikita!      You are completely welcome to use type()! However, if I were you Id consider what the type of 9 is and what the type of 9 is. Try putting it into the shell and seeing what goes down!      In other words, Im not sure that code will work in the way you expect it to!      Hope this helps,      Roman  Hello everyone!      Movie is happening tonight at Rashid Auditorium (Gates 4) from 7:30   9:30pm! Its after the homework so youll have time to grab dinner and join us for some awesome time with a great movie. Right now it is still a tie between Rocky and The Imitation Game, but you can change that and vote here 64.      And well provide snacks! Come and chill so that we can get to know you : )      Hope to see some of you there,   Max  Hello Bryan!      So youre definitely allowed to use reverseString as a helper function for endsWith. As for the first part, Im not 100% sure if you can or cant use s[:: 1] in other functions, but since you can use reverseString instead and youll have to define it either way, Id recommend you usereverseString as a helper to play it safe for now!      Hope this helps,      Roman  Hello Dan!      When they say rotation, they mean moving the last number to the front and shifting each other digit accordingly. So, for the number 4871, the rotations would be:      4871   &gt; 1487   &gt; 7148   &gt; 8714   &gt; 4871 (note these rotations are ignoring the implicit leading zeros, though not every case does so as noted in the problem statement)      So, for 213, the possible rotations would be 321, 132, and 213 again (so 123 would not be possible)      I hope this clarifies the problem for you!      Roman  Hello Jennifer!      So, when solving this problem, its helpful to sort of write out the rotations that are possible for a given number. So, lets consider 3412. (Note that for now were ignoring the case where we rotate while considering the leading zeros)        <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6px" width="209" height="150"><tbody><tr><td>Rotations</td><td>Number</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>2341</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1234</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>4123</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>  3412  </td></tr></tbody></table>     So, what exactly is it that were doing at every step? And what mathematical operations can do that for us in python? Before you use the math, make sure that it works for arbitrary cases (like rotating 6942 as well).      After youve figured that out, its helpful to consider exactly what the function is supposed to do. For the form isRotation(x,y), were trying to determine if x is a rotation of y. Or, in other words, if we can rotate y to create x.      I hope this helps you further along!      [Also, for the mod calculations you were doing, maybe it was a typo, but just in case, 3412 % 1000 is 412, and 3412 % 100 is 12 (because 1000 goes into 3412 three times completely, leaving a remainder of 412; and 100 goes into 3412 thirty four times completely, leaving a remainder of 12). I probably just misunderstood but just in case!]      Try to get some sleep!      Roman  Hello Yuqian!      They mean the same thing in the context of this homework (so by cased character they mean a character in the alphabet)!      Hope this helps,      Roman  Hello Isadora!      When considering the rotated value of a number, Id recommend you consider just normal rotations (like 123   &gt; 312   &gt; 231   &gt; 123) before considering the zero rotations [by which I mean rotations that consider the implicit leading zeros as that particular case does (like 123   &gt; 3012 ...)].      Then, consider exactly how you rotate a number. If I give you a number and ask for all the possible rotations of that number (not including the leading zero case), how many are there? (So how many rotations of 123 exist? of 54678? of 89?). Then, consider exactly how you rotate a number once. Exactly what mathematical operations could you use to perform the rotation 123   &gt; 312? In english, youre just taking off the last number and moving it to the front. But how do you translate that to python? (Though from looking at your code youve answered all these questions except the first: how do many possible rotations are there for a given number?)      I looked at your code briefly, and it seems odd that youd have a return statement in your Rotate function within the while loop. Doesnt that mean that you only rotate the input once?      Finally, after you feel youve covered all cases except for the leading zero case, try and determine what all the leading zero cases have in common, and what, if anything, you can do to make them identical to one another (a helper function perhaps?)      Sorry for the extraordinarily long response! I hope it helps!      Roman        Hello Kenan!      As far as the unboundLocalError, consider what happens if your code doesnt enter the for loop for some reason   would index123 be defined in    in that case?      As far as commenting on the logic of your code,we generally dont do that, as we feel it denies students a learning opportunity. But if you have any further questions on aligning your codes function with your intentions, wed be happy to discuss at OH!      Hope this helps,      Roman  Hello Benjamin!      The purpose of those questions is to figure out how to manipulate numbers using the operations we learned before strings, so please dont use strings for those two problems. But thank you for asking!      Good skill,      Roman  Hello!      As Professor Rudina mentioned in class the other day, were considering playing a movie for peeps on a big screen somewhere on campus if enough of you are interested!      As it stands, the two options that came up were Rocky and the Imitation Game. So, if enough people vote for an option, well watch one on Sunday at 7 PM!      Thanks!     [*] Rocky  [*] The Imitation Game  Hello!      Youre totally free to string slice, just no string methods at all!      Thanks,      Roman  Hello Yang!      Professor Rudina did not see it after lecture!     I hope you find it!      Roman Hello!  The thinking for this question is that the empty string is before and after abc as well as in between each letter.  I hope this helps!  Roman I think youre right it could give you 2103, but couldnt it also give 3210 with one more rotation?      0321 ==&gt; 1032 ==&gt; 2103 ==&gt; 3210  Hello Shenhan!      It looks like for the number 2xxxx , it will return 2, because the loop stops once you get to a number below 10 (so the leftmost digit is always ignored in the currsum).      Does that make sense?      Consider code tracing for when n = 88, and I think youll see the issue!      Hope this helps,      Roman  Hello Suraj!      As far as I know, there will be no official practice quiz, but the small group sessions are expressly for that purpose, and ensuring you feel comfortable with the roc and ct youve seen up to this point (in addition to todays recitation) should provide a healthy amount of preparation!      Hope this helps!      Roman Hey!    Yupp probably.. however please email your TA and we will ensure you get a small group session that you can attend!     Best,  Rishabh Im sorry my language was unclear! Since the quiz and hws are on the same material, all of our small groups will be covering the same topics, just with different questions. The questions on Wednesdays and Thursdays small groups are the same, and the questions for both of Fridays small groups are also the same (so the questions from Thursdays are different from Fridays, but they are on the same material)  I hope thats not more confusing! Beginning next week well have uniform small groups since evry weeks quiz and hw will be on the same material so theres no need to differentiate.Hi Mansi,    Remember that using continue will skip the iteration of the loop you are currently on and move on to the next iteration in the loop, so I dont believe your second if statement ever gets reached. Hope that helps!  Also, Gracia, considerthe second iteration of your while loop.      While youre correct that (11 // 10**1) %10 == 1, what is 11 // 10? And would that value keep the loop running?      So, while the contents of your loop seem right, it might be the loop guard thats causing you trouble.      I hope this helps!      Roman:)  Hello Tanvi!      It isnt at allincorrect to use only if statements in this function, since each of these cases isalmost completely distinct, so I consider it more a matter of style, and what you want to demonstrate with your code. For example, since if elif else statements come together, you could use those as a way of telling whoever is reading your code that these three conditions determine one aspect of what your function is computing (if that makes sense).      Long story short, in this case there is no functional difference between using only if statements or if elif else!      I hope this helps!      Roman:)
