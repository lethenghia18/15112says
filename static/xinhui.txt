 Hi Isabella,      It would work if you have Polynomial([1,0, 3,5])*10 instead of 10*Polynomial([1,0, 3,5]), because when multiplying two objects, python try to call the left objects (in this test case, 10) __mul__ method, but __mul__ doesnt exist for 10. Thats why you want to have __rmul__, because if the left object doesnt have __mul__ method, python will then call the right objects (in this test case, Polynomial([1,0, 3,5])) __rmul__ method.      Hope that helps,   Xinhui  Hi Yuqian,      you should include the case wherecoeffs == [] or coeffs == [0,0,0,..], and both of them should return 0.       Xinhui  Hi Jennifer,      KeyError: wilma means you are trying to access the key wilma in a dictionary but the dictionary does not contain key wilma.      when you do    is it guaranteed that d[j] is in d[i] ?     Hi Cristina,      This is the rubric for style grading, which includes the design of functions.      https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/notes style.html       Hope that helps,   Xinhui  Hi Shenhan,      whats did you input as program?        how did you call the function?  Hi Vidya,      I dont think you can assume plaintextstring for encrypt() is non empty    ifit is, you can simply return empty string.   For password string, i think you can assume it is non empty.   I dont think you can assume length ofpassword string is lessthan or equal to the length of the plaintext string.      Hope that helps,   Xinhui  Hi Nikita,      LookAndSay([1,2,1,3,3,4,6,4]) = [(1,1),(1,2),(1,1),(2,3),(1,4),(1,6),(1,4)], recurring numbers will not be clumped together.      Hope that helps,   Xinhui     Hi Annie,       :)           Hi Nikita,      it will break out of    And if break aligns with the inner for loop, it will break out of the outer for loop.      Hope that helps,   Xinhui  Hi Cynthia,      you need to consider the multiline string defined by both single and double quotes. Also, multiline string can only be defined by triple quote, so single quote and double quotes can only used to define one line string.      Hope that helps,   Xinhui  Hi Kenan,      This is because your function name is string: so on line 6, when you call string.whitespace, it thinks youre calling the function, and the function does not have the attribute. Problem should be solved if you change the name of the function.      Hope this helps,   Xinhui  Hi Vidya,      The count is 4 because abc =   a    b    c  , so there are 4 empty string in abc.      Hope this helps,   Xinhui     Hi Nikita,      strip only removes leading and trailing spaces;   while removeSpaces remove all spaces in the input.      For example,      strip( a b ) = a b   removeSpaces( a b ) = ab      Hope that helps,   Xinhui  Hi Kenan,      Unfortunately we do not give partial credits for coding homework. The reason is that programming is a practical science, and in real world the code has to work perfectly to avoid possible disaster (according to Professor Kosbie who created this course). However in quizzes and exams we will give partial credits.      Good luck,   Xinhui Hi Kenan,    Can you post your code here? We can try to figure out whats going on.  Hi Kenan,      This means your code has an infinite loop when given edge cases or some complicated input. Note that we have more test cases on autolab than the ones we released. I would suggest start thinking of edge cases and extreme cases and analyze how your code wouldwork in those cases.      Hope that helps,   Xinhui  Hi Kenan,      Unfortunately we do not have the test cases. I understand how frustrating debugging can be, but its also very important for you to think of test cases to test your own code. It would also be helpful in the future    as the course proceeds, we will not give any test cases, so it would be good practice to write your own :)  Hi Chen,      In Autolab we have more test cases, so even if you passed all test cases we gave you, its still possible that some functions are not completely right.      Hope that helps,   Xinhui Hi Annie,    The function should return the index of the original string s, not the index of the string youre looking at.     Hope that helps,  Xinhui  Hi Tara,      for the find function, it returns thelowest index in s where the substring t is found. So in this case, if you start from the 3rd digit in s, that is bba, bbis found is the 0th index of bba, which means 3rd index of the original string s. So it returns 3. Note that find function does not return how many t are in s start from a given index.       Hi Kenan,    321 is the same as 0321, so when you rotate it, it gives you 3210.     Hope this helps,  Xinhui  Hi Gracia,      when theres an infinite loop, you wanna check over all the loops you have    in this case, the two while loops. Notice the condition of the firstwhile loop, the loop terminates only when any digit of z equals to abs(n), but when abs(n) has more than 1 digit, the loop would never terminate. Same with the second while loop.      Hope this helps,   Xinhui  Hi Gracia, one useful way to debug is to use the print statement, in this case, you can do       to see what the function returns. Hope this helps!
